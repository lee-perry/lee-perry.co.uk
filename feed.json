And when we do so we are allowing very dangerous footballers far too much time and room on the ball - and we are being punished for it far too often.</p>\n<p>Ironically, for Burnley, we keep getting caught out by long balls over the top too, so suspect our defence is committed too high up the pitch, without the pace that the attackers we are facing seem to have, to get back.</p>\n<p>One thing is for sure - this is the most exciting team Burnley have had in many decades.

A couple of opportunities went unrewarded, before Josh Brownhill sliced the ball past Vicario, rolling in off the far post.\n\nA few observations.\n\nOur playing out from the back is too flat-footed - we are being pressed back onto our goal line, rather than effectively moving forward.  So when we lose the ball, we lose it in dangerous positions.\n\nAt the other end of the pitch, we are not pressing the opposition, allowing them to build momentum from the back in a way that we currently cannot.\n\nWe give the ball away far too often - especially when we are moving forward, leaving us vulnerable to quick counter-attacks.  And when we do so we are allowing very dangerous footballers far too much time and room on the ball - and we are being punished for it far too often.\n\nIronically, for Burnley, we keep getting caught out by long balls over the top too, so suspect our defence is committed too high up the pitch, without the pace that the attackers we are facing seem to have, to get back.\n\nOne thing is for sure - this is the most exciting team Burnley have had in many decades.  Sort the defensive frailties out, and it will move up the table.\n\n[Game highlights video](https://www.burnleyfootballclub.com/content/burnley-v-tottenham-hotspur-highlights) available for subscribers on Clarets+.\n\n<div class=\"container\">\n\t<ul class=\"image-gallery\">\n\t\t<li><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/97910/2023/7efce162be.jpeg\" alt=\"Brun Valley - Burnley v Tottenham\" loading=\"lazy\"><div class=\"overlay\"><span><a href=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/97910/2023/7efce162be.jpeg\" target=\"_blank\">Brun Valley - Burnley v Tottenham</a></span></div></li>\n\t\t<li><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/97910/2023/img-2230.jpeg\" alt=\"Burnley Cricket Club - Burnley v Tottenham\" loading=\"lazy\"><div class=\"overlay\"><span><a href=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/97910/2023/img-2230.jpeg\" target=\"_blank\">Burnley Cricket Club - Burnley v Tottenham</a></span></div></li>\n\t\t<li><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/97910/2023/img-2232.jpeg\" alt=\"Turf Moor - Burnley v Tottenham\" loading=\"lazy\"><div class=\"overlay\"><span><a href=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/97910/2023/img-2232.jpeg\" target=\"_blank\">Turf Moor - Burnley v Tottenham</a></span></div></li>\n\t\t<li><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/97910/2023/img-2234.jpeg\" alt=\"Sean Dyche on Fanzone screen - Burnley v Tottenham\" loading=\"lazy\"><div class=\"overlay\"><span><a href=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/97910/2023/img-2234.jpeg\" target=\"_blank\">Sean Dyche on Fanzone screen - Burnley v Tottenham</a></span></div></li>\n\t\t<li><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/97910/2023/img-2235.jpeg\" alt=\"Warm up - Burnley v Tottenham\" loading=\"lazy\"><div class=\"overlay\"><span><a href=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/97910/2023/img-2235.jpeg\" target=\"_blank\">Warm up - Burnley v Tottenham</a></span></div></li>\n\t\t<li><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/97910/2023/img-2237.jpeg\" alt=\"Lineups - Burnley v Tottenham\" loading=\"lazy\"><div class=\"overlay\"><span><a href=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/97910/2023/img-2237.jpeg\" target=\"_blank\">Lineups - Burnley v Tottenham</a></span></div></li>\n\t\t<li><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/97910/2023/img-2238.jpeg\" alt=\"Leading - Burnley v Tottenham\" loading=\"lazy\"><div class=\"overlay\"><span><a href=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/97910/2023/img-2238.jpeg\" target=\"_blank\">Leading - Burnley v Tottenham</a></span></div></li>\n\t\t<li><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/97910/2023/img-2239.jpeg\" alt=\"Second Half - Burnley v Tottenham\" loading=\"lazy\"><div class=\"overlay\"><span><a href=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/97910/2023/img-2239.jpeg\" target=\"_blank\">Second Half - Burnley v Tottenham</a></span></div></li>\n\t</ul>\n</div>\n",

If indieVelo has a weakness, much like RGT, it is the weakness of the back of the field - and I wasn't really in a good place to be racing by myself today.\r\n\r\nWas also pleased that the autocat let me into D+, even though strictly I sit in Cat C.  That meant that in theory, I could be competitive, more so if I hadn't hung on to the ZSun category C ride for 90 minutes the evening prior.\r\n\r\nThe Climbers Gambit course is a beast.  Largely rolling with a couple of decent climbs through the dinosaurs.  The last 6km are a relentless trawl from sea level up to the Epic KOM banner.\r\n\r\nI started off well, firmly holding the top 10 for the first half, but not doing especially well through the primes (point-scoring segments for those who have not raced on Zwift).  Things unraveled from halfway onwards after helping bridge to the group at 8th, the enlargened group promptly dropped me at the beginning of the climb, which I spent ensuring that I was not caught by 13th (I refuse to finish in 13th, so would have to let 14th past too!).  At one point near the top I caught right up to 11th - but the energy burned meant that I had nothing to respond with as they again pulled away.\r\n\r\nI was happy with my performance overall, but I could have been much higher on slightly fresher legs.\r\n\r\n29.08km > | 678m ‚åÉ | 1:10:08 | 174bpm | 204w | 848kcal | 12/29\r\n\r\n#virtualCycling #zwift #trainEveryDay\r\n\r\n<div class=\"container\">\r\n\t<ul class=\"image-gallery\">\r\n\t\t<li><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/97910/2023/img-0785.jpeg\" alt=\"TFC Mad Monday on Climber's Gambit\" loading=\"lazy\"><div class=\"overlay\"><span><a href=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/97910/2023/img-0785.jpeg\" target=\"_blank\">TFC Mad Monday on Climber's Gambit</a></span></div></li>\r\n\t\t<li><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/97910/2023/img-0790.jpeg\" alt=\"Results - TFC Mad Monday on Climber's Gambit\" loading=\"lazy\"><div class=\"overlay\"><span><a href=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/97910/2023/img-0790.jpeg\" target=\"_blank\">Results - TFC Mad Monday on Climber's Gambit</a></span></div></li>\r\n\t\t<li><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/97910/2023/screenshot-2023-08-28-at-21.29.31.jpeg\" alt=\"Route - TFC Mad Monday on Climber's Gambit\" loading=\"lazy\"><div class=\"overlay\"><span><a href=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/97910/2023/screenshot-2023-08-28-at-21.29.31.jpeg\" target=\"_blank\">Route - TFC Mad Monday on Climber's Gambit</a></span></div></li>\r\n\t\t<li><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/97910/2023/screenshot-2023-08-28-at-21.29.58.jpeg\" alt=\"3D Profile - TFC Mad Monday on Climber's Gambit\" loading=\"lazy\"><div class=\"overlay\"><span><a href=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/97910/2023/screenshot-2023-08-28-at-21.29.58.jpeg\" target=\"_blank\">3D Profile - TFC Mad Monday on Climber's Gambit</a></span></div></li>\r\n\t\t<li><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/97910/2023/screenshot-2023-08-28-at-21.37.08.jpeg\" alt=\"Stats - TFC Mad Monday on Climber's Gambit\" loading=\"lazy\"><div class=\"overlay\"><span><a href=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/97910/2023/screenshot-2023-08-28-at-21.37.08.jpeg\" target=\"_blank\">Stats - TFC Mad Monday on Climber's Gambit</a></span></div></li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n</div>\n",

The catapult can fire at the nearest guard post on the island from your shore.  Set it up and fire at the tower until destroyed.\n\nBuild a transport ship, and transport the catapult onto the island.  Carefully destroy each tower, killing any lions and crocodiles when you get the chance to do so.\n\nUse the transport to bring a gang of 5 villagers across, build a storage pit, and get the team to mine stone.  Bring another gang of villagers across, and use them to build a town centre, and two watch towers.\n\nLook to your town centre, and begin the civilisation upgrade.\n\nFinally, look to your granary on the main island.  Select the option to upgrade your watch tower to a sentry tower, and then to a watch tower.  Once those upgrades complete, victory is yours!\n\n## Video\n[www.youtube.com/watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE6z4zsO_Es)\n",

Once there, if you have a recent Chromebook compatible with the Linux Development Environment, you shouild see an option to turn this on.\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/97910/2023/04f76fef53.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"562\" alt=\"\">\n\nClick 'Next to proceed':\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/97910/2023/48a0d18ea5.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"497\" alt=\"\">\n\nHaving turned on the development environment, choose your username for the Linux environment and the size of the disk that you will allocate to it.  You can change this up and down later, but here I'm leaving 64GB for the Chromebook, and giving the remainder to the Linux environment - that is predominantly what I am intending to use most on this machine.\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/97910/2023/1aa50ed802.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"497\" alt=\"\">\n\nFinally, open up the Linux 'Terminal' application.  That will open up the Penguin Command Line Interface that you will use to control the linux environment.\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/97910/2023/1f00932318.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"445\" alt=\"\">\n\nrun a quick 'python --version' in Penguin, and you will see the version of Python installed on the machine.\n\nI'll leave it there for this article, but check out the articles that follow in the [Chromebook](https://lee-perry.co.uk/categories/chromebook/) to see how I got on!\n",

Note the jinja templating inside the curly brackets, calling in the content of linked templates.\n\n```\n<html>\n    <head>\n      <meta charset=\"utf-8\">\n      <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\">\n      <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\">\n      <!-- load MUI -->\n      <link href=\"//cdn.muicss.com/mui-0.9.39/css/mui.min.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" />\n      <script src=\"//cdn.muicss.com/mui-0.9.39/js/mui.min.js\"></script>\n    </head>\n    <body>\n        <div class=\"mui-panel\">Menu Bar - \n            <button class=\"mui-btn mui-btn--raised\"><a href=\"/index\">Home</a></button>\n            <button class=\"mui-btn mui-btn--raised\"><a href=\"/100Days\">100 Days</a></button>\n        </div>\n        <hr>\n        {% block content %}{% endblock %}\n    </body>\n</html>\n```\n\n## index.html\nThen we create all of the other page templates - note the jinja templating again, first declaring the extension of the base template, declaring the block content, and then defining the content.\n\n```\n{% extends \"base.html\" %}\n\n{% block content%}\n\t\t<h1>Hello!</h1>\n\t\t<p>This is the text we've included in our HTML files</p>\n\n{% endblock%}\n```\n\nFinally, we return to the route folder, and run flask.\n\n```\ncd ..\ncd ..\nflask run\n\n```\n\nOne extra thing that we can do is to install the python-dotenv, defining the app within the environment to speed up each launch.\n\n```\npip install python-dotenv\ntouch .flaskenv\nenv | grep FLASK_APP\nflask run\n\n```\n",

				"content_html": "<p>Alcohol and substance abuse is a sensitive area which can and does impact on the ability of employees to perform not only safety critical tasks, but also their core duties well.  This article looks at the legislative basis for drug and alcohol management policies and testing regimes in the workplace, from a health and safety point of view.</p>\n<p>Like other people management topics as stress there is a confluence of interests in this area with the Human Resources or Human Capital Management function.  Similar to those other topics, this issue is not solely about what happens in the workplace either - with behaviour being influenced by a whole range of factors outwith the workplace that employers have only visibility of.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-law\">The Law</h2>\n<p>Firstly it is important to be clear that there is nothing written directly in Health &amp; Safety legislation on the topic of drug and alcohol management in the workplace.  This topic is not unique in that, and while this section will look at the legislation in this area from a health and safety point of view, there will often be direct statutory offences under other (ie road traffic / misuse of drugs) legislation with more relevant regulators.  That principle is important for the sections that follow.</p>\n<p>Though there is no specific health and safety legislation on this topic, there is plenty of general legislation that does apply including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the general duties towards employees and others who may be affected by the undertaking in Sections 2 and 3 of the Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974.</li>\n<li>to set out the health and safety policy and arrangements under Section 2 of the same.</li>\n<li>the requirements to carry out risk assessments, and to make arrangements to implement their findings under the Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999.</li>\n<li>it is also worth pointing out that employees also have a duty, to a standard of reasonableness, to take care of the health and safety of themselves and others, and to co-operate with the employer - the latter being especially important when looking to implement drug and alcohol policies in the workplace.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"section-3-policy\">Section 3 Policy</h2>\n<p>Section 3 of the Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974 is worded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>(1)It shall be the duty of every employer to conduct his undertaking in such a way as to ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, that persons not in his employment who may be affected thereby are not thereby exposed to risks to their health or safety.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>One of the challenges for the Health and Safety Executive is that Section 3 can be read so broadly as to extend to almost anything.  It could be interpreted for example as extending to road traffic accidents and medical negligence, for example.</p>\n<h2 id=\"enforcement\">Enforcement</h2>\n<p>For this reason HSE publishes its <a href=\"https://www.hse.gov.uk/enforce/opalert.htm\">policy statement</a> on Section 3, setting out where it will focus its efforts.  In practical terms this means that where more relevant regulators exist, HSE will leave enforcement to that regulator, providing technical expertise where necessary to support, or perhaps investigation health and safety breaches in parallel (with corporate manslaughter, for example).</p>\n<p>This means that HSE would only exceptionally become involved in road traffic accident investigations, leaving the police to lead on the investigation and enforcement.  This is significant of course, as statistically road traffic accidents are both a significant source of workplace accidents in this country, and also a topic where drug and alcohol impairment is incredibly important.</p>\n<p>That is not to say that drug and alcohol impairment is not important to HSE, clearly drug and alcohol impairment in safety critical applications is a significant risk factor.  Where impairment was a factor in industrial accidents HSE would need to consider the dutyholder‚Äôs approach to drug and alcohol management in their investigation.</p>\n<h2 id=\"guidance\">Guidance</h2>\n<p>With that in mind HSE publishes <a href=\"https://www.hse.gov.uk/alcoholdrugs/\">guidance</a> for dutyholders on the management of drug and alcohol misuse in the workplace that is centred around:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>consultation with employees on arrangements</li>\n<li><strong>focussing on safety critical work</strong></li>\n<li>setting out the arrangements within the health and safety policy</li>\n<li>being clear about what you may wish to achieve from screening and testing</li>\n<li>supporting people with drug and alcohol problems.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"scope-creep\">Scope Creep</h2>\n<p>One of the key challenges for practitioners revolves back to HSE‚Äôs point about being clear about what you wish to achieve on this topic.  Drug and alcohol screening detects not only impairment, but use, and often use that has nothing to do with the workplace, and that may even be prescribed.</p>\n<p>So as health and safety practitioners we should be making sure that our drug and alcohol policies are proportionate to and focus on risk.  The organisations that we work for may want more expansive drug and alcohol screening programs to identify use more widely, of a broader cohort of substances.  There may be good performance reasons for that - but they have little to do with proportionate risk-based health and safety management.</p>\n<h2 id=\"coming-up\">Coming up</h2>\n<p>I will return to this topic in a later article(s) to talk about implementation of drug and alcohol testing policies, and will propose that, done properly, drug and alcohol testing policies are not purely a reactive measure after the horse has bolted, but can contribute to the development of a healthy and positive health and safety culture.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",

Similar to those other topics, this issue is not solely about what happens in the workplace either - with behaviour being influenced by a whole range of factors outwith the workplace that employers have only visibility of.  \n\n## The Law\nFirstly it is important to be clear that there is nothing written directly in Health & Safety legislation on the topic of drug and alcohol management in the workplace.  This topic is not unique in that, and while this section will look at the legislation in this area from a health and safety point of view, there will often be direct statutory offences under other (ie road traffic / misuse of drugs) legislation with more relevant regulators.  That principle is important for the sections that follow.\n\nThough there is no specific health and safety legislation on this topic, there is plenty of general legislation that does apply including:\n- the general duties towards employees and others who may be affected by the undertaking in Sections 2 and 3 of the Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974.\n- to set out the health and safety policy and arrangements under Section 2 of the same.\n- the requirements to carry out risk assessments, and to make arrangements to implement their findings under the Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999.\n- it is also worth pointing out that employees also have a duty, to a standard of reasonableness, to take care of the health and safety of themselves and others, and to co-operate with the employer - the latter being especially important when looking to implement drug and alcohol policies in the workplace.\n\n## Section 3 Policy\nSection 3 of the Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974 is worded as follows:\n\n> (1)It shall be the duty of every employer to conduct his undertaking in such a way as to ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, that persons not in his employment who may be affected thereby are not thereby exposed to risks to their health or safety.\n\nOne of the challenges for the Health and Safety Executive is that Section 3 can be read so broadly as to extend to almost anything.  It could be interpreted for example as extending to road traffic accidents and medical negligence, for example.  \n\n## Enforcement\nFor this reason HSE publishes its [policy statement](https://www.hse.gov.uk/enforce/opalert.htm) on Section 3, setting out where it will focus its efforts.  In practical terms this means that where more relevant regulators exist, HSE will leave enforcement to that regulator, providing technical expertise where necessary to support, or perhaps investigation health and safety breaches in parallel (with corporate manslaughter, for example).\n\nThis means that HSE would only exceptionally become involved in road traffic accident investigations, leaving the police to lead on the investigation and enforcement.  This is significant of course, as statistically road traffic accidents are both a significant source of workplace accidents in this country, and also a topic where drug and alcohol impairment is incredibly important.\n\nThat is not to say that drug and alcohol impairment is not important to HSE, clearly drug and alcohol impairment in safety critical applications is a significant risk factor.  Where impairment was a factor in industrial accidents HSE would need to consider the dutyholder‚Äôs approach to drug and alcohol management in their investigation.\n\n## Guidance\nWith that in mind HSE publishes [guidance](https://www.hse.gov.uk/alcoholdrugs/) for dutyholders on the management of drug and alcohol misuse in the workplace that is centred around:\n- consultation with employees on arrangements\n- **focussing on safety critical work**\n- setting out the arrangements within the health and safety policy\n- being clear about what you may wish to achieve from screening and testing\n- supporting people with drug and alcohol problems.\n\n## Scope Creep\nOne of the key challenges for practitioners revolves back to HSE‚Äôs point about being clear about what you wish to achieve on this topic.  Drug and alcohol screening detects not only impairment, but use, and often use that has nothing to do with the workplace, and that may even be prescribed.\n\nSo as health and safety practitioners we should be making sure that our drug and alcohol policies are proportionate to and focus on risk.  The organisations that we work for may want more expansive drug and alcohol screening programs to identify use more widely, of a broader cohort of substances.  There may be good performance reasons for that - but they have little to do with proportionate risk-based health and safety management.\n\n## Coming up\nI will return to this topic in a later article(s) to talk about implementation of drug and alcohol testing policies, and will propose that, done properly, drug and alcohol testing policies are not purely a reactive measure after the horse has bolted, but can contribute to the development of a healthy and positive health and safety culture.\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/97910/2023/315d2ad31e.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"401\" alt=\"\">\n",

The residential units are provided with individual detection and alarm systems, the common areas of the building are not.

The answer is really quite simple, and lies in the design of the buildings themselves.  The dominance of single stair core designs for apartment blocks or blocks of flats in the UK presents a conflict in the event of fire between the need for firefighters to scale the staircase with their equipment, and for residents to evacuation down it.  A defend-in place strategy resolves that conflict by holding residents unaffected by fire in their apartments, and reserving the staircase primarily for firefighters to reach the areas of the building affected by fire.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-needed-for-a-defend-in-place-strategy-to-work\">What is needed for a defend in place strategy to work?</h2>\n<p>For a defend in place evacuation strategy to work, the <a href=\"https://safetyfactor.co.uk/2023/02/07/what-is-compartmentation.html\">compartmentation</a> to the building needs to be adequate.

Regulation 4 requires <em>building work</em> to comply with <a href=\"https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2010/2214/schedule/1/made\">schedule 1</a>, while Regulation 6 requires material changes in use to conform to parts of schedule 1, including for fire safety purposes parts B1,B2,B3,B4(2) and B5.</p>\n<p>Schedule 1 sets out the functional requirements for safety in buildings:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>B1 - Means of warning and escape</li>\n<li>B2 - Internal fire spread (linings)</li>\n<li>B3 - Internal fire spread (structure)</li>\n<li>B4 - External fire spread</li>\n<li>B4(2) - (roof only)</li>\n<li>B5 - Access and facilities for the fire service.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"approved-document-b\">Approved Document B</h2>\n<p>The functional requirements set out in Schedule 1 to the Building Regulations are high level, goal setting objectives.</p>\n<p>To provide a detailed means of achieving those objectives HM Government has published two volumes of Approved Document B which set out a design specification to comply with the functional requirements.\n<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/fire-safety-approved-document-b\">Approved Document B (fire safety): Volume 1 - Dwellings</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/fire-safety-approved-document-b\">Approved Document B (fire safety): Volume 2- Buildings other than dwellings</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"limitations\">Limitations</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>The requirement in respect of approved documents set out in Section 7 of the 1984 Act is to comply with the document at the time in force.

So again, unless there is a material change to a building, no requirement to upgrade the fire safety design is triggered.</li>\n<li>For this reason a number of other guides and standards have been produced for the management of fire safety in buildings post-occupation, we will return to look at these in a subsequent article.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"degradation\">Degradation</h2>\n<p>Some proposed alterations to buildings will degrade or remove existing fire precautions.

Regulation 4 requires *building work* to comply with [schedule 1](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2010/2214/schedule/1/made), while Regulation 6 requires material changes in use to conform to parts of schedule 1, including for fire safety purposes parts B1,B2,B3,B4(2) and B5.\n\nSchedule 1 sets out the functional requirements for safety in buildings:\n- B1 - Means of warning and escape\n- B2 - Internal fire spread (linings)\n- B3 - Internal fire spread (structure)\n- B4 - External fire spread\n- B4(2) - (roof only)\n- B5 - Access and facilities for the fire service.\n\n## Approved Document B\nThe functional requirements set out in Schedule 1 to the Building Regulations are high level, goal setting objectives.\n\nTo provide a detailed means of achieving those objectives HM Government has published two volumes of Approved Document B which set out a design specification to comply with the functional requirements.\n[Approved Document B (fire safety): Volume 1 - Dwellings](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/fire-safety-approved-document-b)\n[Approved Document B (fire safety): Volume 2- Buildings other than dwellings](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/fire-safety-approved-document-b)\n\n## Limitations\n1. The requirement in respect of approved documents set out in Section 7 of the 1984 Act is to comply with the document at the time in force.  As such there is no requirement to improve the fire safety design of buildings as the specification strengthens within future editions of Approved Document B.\n2. The law applies to new buildings, or to buildings when they undergo material change.  So again, unless there is a material change to a building, no requirement to upgrade the fire safety design is triggered.\n3. For this reason a number of other guides and standards have been produced for the management of fire safety in buildings post-occupation, we will return to look at these in a subsequent article.\n\n## Degradation\nSome proposed alterations to buildings will degrade or remove existing fire precautions.  According to Regulation 3 of the Building Regulations that alteration will be material, and therefore building work, if it causes B1,B3,B4,B5 (or part M, access) to be not complied with where it had been, or to be less complied with.\n\nThis is a significant protection - as it requires building notice and plans to be submitted for alterations that remove or degrade provisions under Regulation 12.\n\nWe hope that you found this explanation useful, please join the conversation below.\n\nüìù\n",

This is probably more true when not coached and following a plan without further interactive guidance.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Threshold tests are actually very straightforward to do - go as hard as you can hold for 30 minutes, and record the average pace and average heart rate through that interval.  Ideally the terrain will be fairly flat, for easy comparison with earlier workouts.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Living within 200m of the Leeds-Liverpool Canal, I always carry out my (run) threshold tests on the canal.  It is flat, and if time correctly, 200m from the shower at the end!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<img src=\"https://leeperry.micro.blog/uploads/2023/e5416969a6.jpg\" alt=\"Barden Mill, at the start of the run.\"> \n\n<br> \n\n<img src=\"https://leeperry.micro.blog/uploads/2023/d47d342853.jpg\" alt=\"Looking back to Barden Mill from the warm-down at dusk.\" >\n\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I ran around 15:30, leaving just enough time to complete the run before running out of light.  The sky was bright and clear, though cold enough to regret not taking a pair of thin gloves on the warmup.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I spent the first 5 minutes firmly in Zone 2, running gently around 6min/km.  After which 30 minutes as fast as I could hold.  I find that my asthma does not generally cope well with running in cold air, and I had trained hard on Fulgaz the night before also - so while I probably could have pushed a little harder, my asthma felt under control at all times.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>That being so I was relatively pleased with a threshold pace of 5:13/km. I last set run thresholds in April 2021, and despite a couple of pretty crappy running years, that is a 15 second improvement.  Threshold heart rate dropping slightly from 176 to 171 confirming either that I did hold a little in reserve, or just that I'm getting older.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I like some of the enhancements that Suunto have made allowing synchronisation of workouts to the Suunto 9 directly from TrainingPeaks. I'll write more on that in a subsequent article, though the watch showing intended and average interval pace is incredibly useful for athletes with my attention span!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<iframe src=\"https://gpx.studio/?state=%7B%22ids%22:%5B%2213M_W2TeJS_gTn5QcmaHvrXjoCtqAuNDK%22%5D%7D&embed&source=otm&running&slope\" width=\"100%\" height=\"500\" frameborder=\"0\"><p><a href=\"https://gpx.studio/?state=%7B%22ids%22:%5B%2213M_W2TeJS_gTn5QcmaHvrXjoCtqAuNDK%22%5D%7D\"></a></p></iframe>\n",

The course was a short test of the Rouvy AR Run functionality, which I had not tried out since leaving Rouvy in September in a strop about their increasingly hard line on interactive trainers in races - which I've no intention of upgrading my smart bike to.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The course is completely flat, made up of a series of legs through the forest, all returning in time to the opening in front of a star shaped pavilion in the centre of the park.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The course is really well executed.  The video clarity and view distance is superb, and the picture stable in comparison to some of the user content on other systems.  The avatar animation likely needs a little refinement - but provides a good focal point in the centre of the picture.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The video is recorded in stabilised 2K resolution.  Like much of the content on Rouvy the footage is filmed at a higher speed than will be used in practice - keep an eye out for comedic pedestrians moonwalking as a result.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I hope that you enjoy the run - let us know what you think in the comments box below.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:separator {\"className\":\"is-style-wide\"} -->\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-wide\" id=\"profile\"/>\n<!-- /wp:separator -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 id=\"profile\">Route Profile</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:group {\"align\":\"full\"} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-group alignfull\"><!-- wp:shortcode -->\n[sgpx gpx=\"/wp-content/uploads/gpx/Prague - Hvezda .gpx\"]\n<!-- /wp:shortcode -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></div>\n<!-- /wp:group -->\n\n<!-- wp:separator {\"className\":\"is-style-wide\"} -->\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-wide\" id=\"profile\"/>\n<!-- /wp:separator -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 id=\"images\">Route Images</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:group {\"align\":\"full\"} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-group alignfull\"><!-- wp:group {\"align\":\"full\"} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-group alignfull\"><!-- wp:gallery {\"ids\":[5018,5019,5020,5021,5022,5023],\"columns\":3,\"linkTo\":\"none\",\"align\":\"full\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery alignfull columns-3 is-cropped\"><ul class=\"blocks-gallery-grid\"><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/97910/2023/3239b466fe.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"5018\" data-full-url=\"https://insiderrr.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/56A9EF6D-89CF-40ED-8C72-AA8E2B479AD2.jpg\" data-link=\"https://insiderrr.uk/?attachment_id=5018\" class=\"wp-image-5018\"/></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/97910/2023/3185351290.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"5019\" data-full-url=\"https://insiderrr.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/D284C763-52BB-417F-BAFA-A564EC0820A5.jpg\" data-link=\"https://insiderrr.uk/?attachment_id=5019\" class=\"wp-image-5019\"/></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/97910/2023/6e38b4b78e.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"5020\" data-full-url=\"https://insiderrr.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/5676A577-466B-48DB-9121-8366A4487BB5.jpg\" data-link=\"https://insiderrr.uk/?attachment_id=5020\" class=\"wp-image-5020\"/></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/97910/2023/639996d491.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"5021\" data-full-url=\"https://insiderrr.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/E761B84E-E2DF-4DE7-858B-F99E84F87098.jpg\" data-link=\"https://insiderrr.uk/?attachment_id=5021\" class=\"wp-image-5021\"/></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/97910/2023/0620ee4e29.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"5022\" data-full-url=\"https://insiderrr.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2CEA2751-3DCC-4E3A-B9C4-8020494E5D23.jpg\" data-link=\"https://insiderrr.uk/?attachment_id=5022\" class=\"wp-image-5022\"/></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/97910/2023/fcf7b99293.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"5023\" data-full-url=\"https://insiderrr.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/F337FF71-97E3-4E25-AA31-CD9B86C6131A.jpg\" data-link=\"https://insiderrr.uk/?attachment_id=5023\" class=\"wp-image-5023\"/></figure></li></ul></figure>\n<!-- /wp:gallery -->\n\n<!-- wp:group -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"></div>\n<!-- /wp:group -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></div>\n<!-- /wp:group --></div>\n<!-- /wp:group -->\n\n<!-- wp:separator {\"className\":\"is-style-wide\"} -->\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-wide\" id=\"images\"/>\n<!-- /wp:separator -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 id=\"data\">Treadmill Route Data</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:shortcode -->\n[table id=4 filter=\"Prague - Hvezda\" hide_columns=\"2,3\"/]\n<!-- /wp:shortcode -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

The ride formed the first stage of the Fulgaz LeJog event in 2021.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The scenery is a wonderful mix of blue skies, green fields and hills, all broken up by occasional traditional Cornish villages and architecture, and sporadic views out to sea.  The drive past Land's End airport is a particular highlight for aviation enthusiasts, and try not to go flying over the handlebars when the big blue van cuts you up at the end..</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The video is recorded in stabilised 4K resolution, recorded at a sensible speed to avoid comedic motions in shot, although I struggled to maintain decent speed in the climbs.

After a couple of kilometres we drop off the canal down a steep path towards Thompson Park.  Instead of turning right to head down to the park and town, we turn left, heading immediately back under the canal, and follow the track straight to the corner of the green, without taking any of the tracks heading left or right.  The final section of the ride takes Queen Victoria Road through some of Burnley's historic back-back terracing, continuing straight over a couple of intersections before eventually arriving at the Thomas Whitham Sixth Form College on Barden Lane.

The first half of the circuit is pan flat along the Fan area of Richmond.  The route passes three statues at the centre of the wide and open Monument Avenue, returning through 180 degrees at the third statue.  This section of the course exists in its own right as a route called the Fan Flats.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The second half of the route drops down to and follows the James River, with the rail line running alongside.  After the route passes the grain silos on the riverside the route turns through a hairpin before climbing up a cobbled stretch before looping back to the start.  This section of the course also exists in its own right as the Cobbled Climbs Route.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We hope that you enjoy the ride - let us know what you

Here the route enters the underground, emerging straight into the Surrey Hills for a climb over Box Hill.  When my wife told me she thought that the underground was a magic place where time stood still, I didn't realise she'd been cycling on Zwift!  The route descends Box Hill, and returns to the start over Tower Bridge, and taking in the views of seminal London skyline around the Gherkin.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph

After taking on the jungle circuit the route retraces steps to the Jarvis tree, but this time continues north along ocean boulevard for a second ride though Titans Grove.

From here the route drops into Calp, before doglegging back to the beach for a superb finish dominated by the sharp butresses of Calp Rock rising from the Mediterranean.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The scenery is a blend of Spanish tourist and expatriate resorts, steep limestone walls, blue skies and deep blue seas.

Understanding how groups and leagues work, and how to subscribe to them, is pretty key to getting the most out of Bkool - more of that in a subsequent article.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We hope that you enjoy the ride -

The first half of the ride is climbing steeply up through narrow forest.  Though the blue skies and green fires make a good combination, views are few and far between.

The scenery is very similar, dominated by skyscrapers and churches - with industrial heritage to the bottom of the course.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The ride is entirely different though, the climbs come early, at the very beginning of the circuit, and much much steeper in this orientation.  There are an exceptionally large number of climb and sprint segments on this ride, with the two big climbs exceptionally challenging.  Don't be surprised to see riders around you almost stationary on the 21% section.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Highlights of the route include the suspended train track on the dockside section of track - there is much traffic on this section, so expect to see at least a few trains on each passing.  Other highlights include the grain store, and the house you ride under on the way.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As an event only route, you will need to join a group ride or event on this route to follow it - we did so on a ZZRC 1.5w/kg ride.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Route Profile</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":3315,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/97910/2023/78f6690ba7.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3315\"/><figcaption><em>Map courtesy of&nbsp;</em><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://zwifthacks.com/app/routes/\" target=\"_blank\">ZwiftHacks</a><em>&nbsp;background&nbsp;</em><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://zwift.com\" target=\"_blank\">¬©Zwift</a></figcaption></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Route Images</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:gallery {\"ids\":[3318,3319,3320,3321,3322,3323,3324,3325,3326,3327],\"columns\":2} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery columns-2 is-cropped\"><ul class=\"blocks-gallery-grid\"><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/97910/2023/d68bdda718.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"3318\" data-full-url=\"https://insiderrr.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Richmond-UCI-Reverse-18.20.31.png\" data-link=\"https://insiderrr.uk/?attachment_id=3318\" class=\"wp-image-3318\"/></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/97910/2023/f526a59820.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"3319\" data-full-url=\"https://insiderrr.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Richmond-UCI-Reverse-18.22.48.png\" data-link=\"https://insiderrr.uk/?attachment_id=3319\" class=\"wp-image-3319\"/></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/97910/2023/93e1820047.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"3320\" data-full-url=\"https://insiderrr.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Richmond-UCI-Reverse-18.33.04.png\" data-link=\"https://insiderrr.uk/?attachment_id=3320\" class=\"wp-image-3320\"/></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/97910/2023/4b0b3a945a.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"3321\" data-full-url=\"https://insiderrr.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Richmond-UCI-Reverse-18.46.19.png\" data-link=\"https://insiderrr.uk/?attachment_id=3321\" class=\"wp-image-3321\"/></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/97910/2023/0882ee2a19.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"3322\" data-full-url=\"https://insiderrr.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Richmond-UCI-Reverse-18.46.47.png\" data-link=\"https://insiderrr.uk/?attachment_id=3322\" class=\"wp-image-3322\"/></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/97910/2023/27056fb4d7.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"3323\" data-full-url=\"https://insiderrr.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Richmond-UCI-Reverse-18.51.19.png\" data-link=\"https://insiderrr.uk/?attachment_id=3323\" class=\"wp-image-3323\"/></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/97910/2023/6d59fa601a.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"3324\" data-full-url=\"https://insiderrr.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Richmond-UCI-Reverse-18.56.32.png\" data-link=\"https://insiderrr.uk/?attachment_id=3324\" class=\"wp-image-3324\"/></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/97910/2023/6a88c72c1e.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"3325\" data-full-url=\"https://insiderrr.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Richmond-UCI-Reverse-19.02.04.png\" data-link=\"https://insiderrr.uk/?attachment_id=3325\" class=\"wp-image-3325\"/></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/97910/2023/c0636e80a8.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"3326\" data-full-url=\"https://insiderrr.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Richmond-UCI-Reverse-19.02.46.png\" data-link=\"https://insiderrr.uk/?attachment_id=3326\" class=\"wp-image-3326\"/></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/97910/2023/1ba66ec1bc.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"3327\" data-full-url=\"https://insiderrr.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Richmond-UCI-Reverse-19.05.45.png\" data-link=\"https://insiderrr.uk/?attachment_id=3327\" class=\"wp-image-3327\"/></figure></li></ul></figure>\n<!-- /wp:gallery -->\n\n<!-- wp:shortcode -->\n[ultimate_post_list_pro id=\"3338\"]\n<!-- /wp:shortcode -->\n",

As I could not see another group ride at low intensity, I decided to drop into the Bkool Simulator for a wee spin.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I chose this route for a number of reasons.  Firstly it was running live with a number of people on course.  Second, I've been to Ayuthaya, a city containing some beautiful Ruins. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This route is available in video and in the 3D simulator.  The video is awfully filmed, with so much bounce and stretch in the picture as to make unwatchable.  The simulator as always makes for pleasant enough viewing - but bears no resemblance to the road filmed in the video.  Dual carriageway in one, single track lane in the other.  Suburban in the video, rural in the simulator.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The BKool simulator has so much potential as a concept - I really want to like it.  I struggle though with that complete disconnect between real world and simulator.  This site is after all, about exploring the world without leaving the garage - and that means the artificial world presented in the simulator needs to reflect it better. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Route Profile</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:html -->\n<iframe style=\"width:100%;height:600px;\" src=\"https://veloviewer.com/segments/23060765/embed2\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>\n<!-- /wp:html -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Images</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:gallery {\"ids\":[2429,2430,2431,2433,2434],\"columns\":2} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery columns-2 is-cropped\"><ul class=\"blocks-gallery-grid\"><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/97910/2023/92d1efbe89.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"2429\" data-full-url=\"https://insiderrr.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screenshot-2020-07-12-at-17.58.40.png\" data-link=\"https://insiderrr.uk/?attachment_id=2429\" class=\"wp-image-2429\"/></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/97910/2023/e6c0daf0fd.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"2430\" data-full-url=\"https://insiderrr.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screenshot-2020-07-12-at-18.10.27.png\" data-link=\"https://insiderrr.uk/?attachment_id=2430\" class=\"wp-image-2430\"/></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/97910/2023/b8bd1c481e.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"2431\" data-full-url=\"https://insiderrr.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screenshot-2020-07-12-at-18.10.36.png\" data-link=\"https://insiderrr.uk/?attachment_id=2431\" class=\"wp-image-2431\"/></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/97910/2023/a4d769c91c.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"2433\" data-full-url=\"https://insiderrr.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screenshot-2020-07-12-at-18.14.19.png\" data-link=\"https://insiderrr.uk/?attachment_id=2433\" class=\"wp-image-2433\"/></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/97910/2023/d8b3ea967a.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"2434\" data-full-url=\"https://insiderrr.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screenshot-2020-07-12-at-18.19.18.png\" data-link=\"https://insiderrr.uk/?attachment_id=2434\" class=\"wp-image-2434\"/></figure></li></ul></figure>\n<!-- /wp:gallery -->\n\n<!-- wp:shortcode -->\n[ultimate_post_list_pro id=\"2685\"]\n<!-- /wp:shortcode -->\n",

While there are some flat routes that we love like Kona and Lava Beds, the AR library is dominated by climbs, and the good flat rides are not especially long.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The IRONMAN SUPERSEAL Sprint course was the first dedicated sprint distance addition to the library - following a <a href=\"https://insiderrr.uk/courses/ironman-vr3-sprint-canyonville/\">20km Canyonville Sprint Course</a> truncated especially for <a href=\"https://insiderrr.uk/tag/ironmanvr3/\">Ironman VR3</a> which we completed 17 - 19 April 2020.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The route is a flat, low-level, coastal route, running out and back along the Silver Strand from Imperial Beach at San Diego to the outskirts of the naval base to the North of the Strand.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As all AR videos, the video is excellently filmed, with high resolution, stable, picture available to stream at 1080p.  It also suffers from the same pitfalls as other AR videos, where the speed of filming is faster than the speed being ridden - this results in moving objects within the video taking on a moonwalk animation.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The imagery though is stupendously good.  Bright blue skies, with clouds for texture, expansive views over San Diego Bay to the East, and the Pacific Ocean to the West, interspersed with naval architecture.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!--

Please read on to see details and photographs on the route, route profiles, and our own ride data on this route.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The Catofeto Spain Coast Ride is a coastal out and back ride in Catalonia.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Starting above Lloret de Mar, the route climbs North East along the coast, before descending to Tossa de Mar.  From here the route winds its way along the coast, until arriving at Sant Feliu de Guixols.  Here the route turns around and reverses back to Tossa de Mar, terminating on the beach.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The scenery is typical Spanish coastline, crumbling sandstone cliffs met be deep blue sky, and occasional glimpses to an even deeper blue sea.  The route, climbs, and it drops, only very rarely is it anything approaching flat. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Unlike most of the rides covered so far, this route is authored by a contributor rather than by Rouvy.  The route is beautifully filmed, only on occasion does the sun bleach out the sky - and this is Spain after all.  The route is filmed from bike, and so the scenery passes with a much more realistic pace to it, and the camera banks with the turns - something we found ourselves doing on our bike!  The clarity of picture is not as deep as the AR routes, even at 1080p, and there is some overlay of base speed data over the video itself (bottom-left).  That does not detract though - this was a thoroughly enjoyable ride.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:gallery

From Lake Colby the road climbs gently towards Harriestown, a little before which the route turns off onto road 186.  The route drops from here, with signs indicating Saranac Lake Regional Airport is to the right.  The route plateaus, coming to a close after Lake Clear.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The scenery is dominated by forest, interspersed with occasional views over lakes and the odd rail crossing.  That combined with a largely deep blue sky makes for a pleasant ride.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This is not a Rouvy AR route, it is stated to be a HD route, and indeed we streamed in 1080p.  While that may be so, the picture is not as crisp as some other 1080p rides we have ridden on Rouvy.  The route suffers a little from filming speed exceeding ride speed, though rarely is this noticeable, and also from timing issues in a couple of places.  All told though, a very pleasant ride. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n<!-- wp:gallery {\"ids\":[2226,2227,2228,2229,2230,2231,2232,2233],\"columns\":0,\"linkTo\":\"attachment\"} -->\n<figure

Please read on to see details and photographs on the route, route profiles, and our own ride data on this route.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The Cape Naturaliste route on Rouvy is a rolling tour of the Cape Naturaliste peninsula in Western Australia. The Naturaliste lighthouse stands to the North of the cape, though we seem to have completely missed it on our ride. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The first part of the ride is a flat stretch along Eagle Bay, with the ocean occasionally coming in to view.  At the settlement at Eagle Bay the route departs from the coast, climbing up to the ridge running along the centre of the Cape.  From here the route climbs gently North to the lighthouse, then heading back South along the same route, continuing past the turn back to Eagle Bay, and coming to an end outside the town of Dunsborough.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The setting is outstanding.  With the occasional views to the ocean, there ride primarily consists of dark green bush contrasting with dark orange sand, opening occasionally to meadow.  Rarely does the view extend much beyond the scrub lining the road.  The weather is a let down though, the sky is largely grey throughout - a deep blue sky would have been much more enticing to ride under.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Like all Rouvy augmented routes, this route is beautifully filmed.

Please read on to see details and photographs on the route, route profiles, and our own ride data on this route.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The Oberlangenegg ‚Äì Langnau Route on Rouvy is a predominantly downhill course starting in Oberlangenegg, and descending to Langnau on a dog legged route toward Bern. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There are two distinct climbs in the first half of the course.  The first ascends steeply to cross Turner mountain before dropping into Vorderstenmoosli.  The second climb heads up through the village of Schangnau toward Wald.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Like all Rouvy augmented routes, this route is beautifully filmed. The picture is stable with resolution available to 1080p.  Similar to other routes it also suffers a little from filming speed exceeding ride speed, though rarely is this noticeable. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Our internet decided to die with around a third of the ride left, so we had to complete the ride in map view.  We are really looking forward to seeing what the remainder of this video has to offer when we ride this route again. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The scenery is superb.  Staying further away from the high peaks, this video is dominated by rolling green hills, deep blue skies, and traditional alpine chalets.  This video is very very nice.  Blue skies throughout only add to the quality of this ride, and only in places does the picture become a little bleached by the sun.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The route was used as the fourth course of the Digital Swiss 5 series hosted by Rouvy in April 2020.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n<!-- wp:gallery

While there are some flat routes that we love like Kona and Lava Beds, the AR library is dominated by climbs, and the good flat rides are not especially long.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The 70.3 Boulder course was the first addition to the library - followed by the 5150 Boulder course, and a <a href=\"https://insiderrr.uk/courses/ironman-vr3-sprint-canyonville/\">20km Canyonville Sprint Course</a> truncated especially for <a href=\"https://insiderrr.uk/tag/ironmanvr3/\">Ironman VR3</a> which we completed 17 - 19 April 2020.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The route starts and ends at Boulder Reservoir, making a clockwise circuit staying to the North of Boulder, under the shadow of the Rockies.  The route heads north toward Lyons, and then Berts Corner, before turning South to head back toward Boulder, via the flanks of Longmont. There is a strange dogleg along Niwot Rd, a little prior to the close, presumably to bring the route up to distance.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As all AR videos, the video is excellently filmed, with high resolution, stable, picture available to stream at 1080p.  It also suffers from the same pitfalls as other AR videos, where the speed of filming is faster than the speed being ridden - this results in moving objects within the video taking on a moonwalk animation.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The imagery though is stupendously good.  Bright blue skies, with clouds for texture, expansive views over the Colorado countryside, with the Rockies forming the backdrop.  Also adding to the experience is some funky local architecture, a couple of nice lakes around Hygiene, and Dodd Reservoir toward the end..</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This

The route starts in High Newton, climbing back up onto Cartmell Fell, and dropping back to Staveley the Southern end of Windermere Lake.  From here the route follows the Western shore of Windermere, before boomeranging around Blelham Tarn, and concluding with the climb to Hawkshead.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As all AR videos, the video is excellently filmed, with high resolution, stable, picture available to stream at 1080p.

The sky is grey throughout, and for a ride in the Lake District there are precious little views of the water.  There are a few fleeing glances towards the Langdale Pikes towards the end, and Wasfel Pike a little before that.  In the main though the video is dominated by narrow roads, surrounded by high foliage, and grey sky, salvaged by the occasional staging inn.  We enjoyed the ride, but we are not too excited about doing it again anytime soon with so many other (and better) AR videos to choose from on Rouvy.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n<!-- wp:heading

All routes on Kinomap seem to be filmed by users, so the quality can be variable - this route is well filmed, the route itself just does not blow us away.  Also some mapping overlay exists on the base video, in part truncated due to the change in screen ratio.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This was our first run on Kinomap with the Zwift RunPod transmitting meaningful data - and therefore the first in which the speed felt anywhere like 'real world'.

The picture is stable with resolution available to 1080p.

Please read on to see details and photographs on the route, route profiles, and our own ride data on this route.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This route is the second of three that were to comprise stage 6 of the ill-fated 2020 Tour de Suisse.  Not to happen in the real world, and to be ridden out in garages around the world on Rouvy instead.  It does not begin where the <a href=\"https://insiderrr.uk/courses/tour-de-suisse-6-fiesch-disentis-sedrun-pt-1/\">first ride terminates</a>, and misses the section between All' Acqua and Biasca.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Starting at the village of Biasca, the route climbs gradually along the Brenno Valley, passing through the villages of Acquarossa and Blenio, with the horizon dominated by the bulk of the Rheinwaldhorn in this early phase, and by the conical Shapiros of Sosto after Acquarossa.  At Olivone the route leaves the Brenno, turning to follow the tributary Brenno del Lucomagno, with the gradient sharpening from here through to the end of the ride, with the scenery much less open and more wooded.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Like all Rouvy augmented routes, this route is beautifully filmed. The picture is stable with resolution available to 1080p.  Similar to other routes it also suffers a little from filming speed exceeding ride speed, though rarely is this noticeable.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Like most Switzerland rides the combination of tall snow capped alpine peaks, lush green meadows, and steep walls make for stupendously sublime scenery.  Blue skies throughout only add to the quality of this ride, and only in places does the picture become a little bleached by the sun.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After a tough <a href=\"https://insiderrr.uk/courses/tour-de-suisse-6-fiesch-disentis-sedrun-pt-1/\">first part to this stage</a>, this route provides for a steadier interlude before the final leg.</p>\n<!--

Please read on to see details and photographs on the route, elevation profile, and our own ride data.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The Javornik Climb was the final ride of our completion of the <a href=\"https://insiderrr.uk/tag/rouvy-specialized-challenge/\">Rouvy Specialised Challenge</a>, 2020.  The route itself is a pleasant rolling amble through the forests of South Bohemia, north of Rouvy's Vimperk base.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The route starts out climbing into the forests out of Susice.  The first climb is fairly brief, the route plateauing, and then dropping sharply before the final longer climb in to Javornik.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The ride passes through village after village, though it seems that there was no particular preference for building on flat land in this part of the Czech Republic though.  Villages arrive on the climbs, the drops and on the flats as well.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Interspersed between the villages are rolling fields, thick pine forests, as well as views to a small hill range on the horizon.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The video quality is an excellent quality HD video, with stable picture, like all Rouvy AR videos.  It also suffers from the same issues that other AR videos do in relation to the speed of movement of other objects, caused by filming speed relative to ride speed.  Again, the traffic is fairly light on this ride, so those foibles are rarely noticeable.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n<!-- wp:gallery

From here the route plateaus and roll through the villages of Blazejovice and Zbytiny. After here we enter the second climb of the route, past Kristanov, before descending into the forest beyond.  This route finishes in a similar place to our earlier<em> </em><a href=\"https://insiderrr.uk/courses/ktis/\">Ktis</a> ride.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Blue skies, rolling green fields, occasionally interspersed with forest, and hills on the horizon, there is much to like about this ride, though overtaking the tractor with an oil leak is a personal favourite - we hope he's had that fixed by now</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The video quality is an excellent quality HD video, with stable picture, like all Rouvy AR videos.  It also suffers from the same issues that other AR videos do in relation to the speed of movement of other objects, caused by filming speed relative to ride speed.  The traffic is fairly light on this ride, so those foibles are rarely noticeable.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n<!-- wp:gallery

Not to happen in the real world, and to be ridden out in garages around the world on Rouvy instead.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Starting at the village of Fiesch, the route climbs out into the Swiss countryside, initially on route 19, before later turning on to route 413 prior to the main climb.  The first couple of km the route climbs steeply before levelling through the villages of Steinhaus, Blitzingen, Ritzingen, Reckingen, Geschinen and Ulrichen.  Here, at the halfway point, the route turns on to the main climb, sandwiched between the Mittaghorn to the North and Teltschehorn and Nufenstock to the South.  The route tops out at Restaurant Nufenen-Passhohe, before descending rapidly towards Airolo.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Like all Rouvy augmented routes, this route is beautifully filmed. The picture is stable with resolution available to 1080p.  Similar to other routes it also suffers a little from filming speed exceeding ride speed, though rarely is this noticeable.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Like most Switzerland rides the combination of tall snow capped alpine peaks, lush green meadows, and steep walls make for stupendously sublime scenery.  Let down slightly by the weather in this video which suffers from grey skies at the outset, which clear to provide blue skies with light clouds as the route climbs.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This is a tough route, with much climb - and our legs certainly knew about it afterwards!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Also, Strava have ceased allowing segments to be created on virtual routes.

That said video is available in UHQ, the picture was stable, and it was filmed on a beautiful day - which all made for a very pleasant virtual run.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The route on the other hand is spectacular, and well worn.  Starting at Notre Dame Cathedral the route crosses the Seine over the Pont d'Arcole.  The route then runs along the Seine, past the Louvre to the right, and the Orsai to the left, with the skyline dominated by the Eiffel Tower and the Pont Alexandre III - coming to an end a little after the bridge.

The last quarter of the ride is a steep descent which should take no more than about 5-6 minutes to complete.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The scenery is predominantly of rolling green hills and trees, and watch out for the cedar barriers rather than armco.  Apparently the top section was only surfaced as recently as 2014.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>For a Rouvy premium video, the video quality is actually pretty poor.  We couldn't get the 1080p video to load, but notwithstanding that the source video is filmed much too quickly with judder and granulation throughout.

Please read on to see details and photographs on the route, route profiles, and our own ride data on this route.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The Col d'√àze is formerly the final stage of the Paris-Nice stage race, and is often used as a final time trial stage.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The Col d'√àze (from Nice) route on Rouvy begins on the edge of Nice in Nice Est.  The route climbs from the off, contouring first around Mont Gros, passing below Mont Leuze and turning inland to finis below Mont Bastide.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The route consists of two main climbs, the first climbing up from Nice to Mont Gros, where a short plateau arrives.  Once Mont Gros is behind the route climbs again, slowly at first and steepening as it passes Mont Leuze on to the Col.  The route plateaus again before a brief final climb up to the finish.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The scenery arrives in three waves.  The climb out of Nice is characterised by traditional French rural architecture.  The climb to the Col d'√àze is dominated by the views over Cap Roux and out to sea.  The final stage is one of green wooded hills.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Again, and it probably will not outlive the ≈†KODA - We Love Cycling Challenge on Rouvy, but an amazing, sparkly, silver Skoda has been parked up alongside the checkpoint barriers on route.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Being a Rouvy Augmented Route the video quality is excellent throughout.

Please read on to see details and photographs on the route, route profiles, and our own ride data on this route.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The Villes-sur-Auzon - Monieux route on Rouvy begins in the village of Villes-sur-Auzon in the Provence-Alpes-C√¥te d'Azur region of France.  The route climbs steadily from the off, making it difficult to find much pace in the early stages.  After around 4km the route eases a little, and climbs more gently through the segment at 12km.  From here the route steepens, climbing more sharply to the top of the climb at 19km.  The final 3kmn of the route are a downhill descent in to the village of Monieux.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The scenery along the route is especially scenic.  The route climbs along a steep wooded gorge, interspersed with white limestone cliffs.  The construction of the road itself provides some of the highlights of this route, where the road has been sculpted into the cliffside.  Our personal favourites are a number of rock tunnels that the road has been carved through, providing window through the hillside.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It may not outlive the ≈†KODA - We Love Cycling Challenge on Rouvy, but an amazing, sparkly, silver Skoda has been parked up along many of the checkpoint barriers on route.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Being a Rouvy Augmented Route the village quality is excellent throughout, and unlike some AR routes this does not suffer from bleaching of the sky.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph

You are to establish Miletus as a great new city.  Miletus is key to bringing Asia under Roman rule, as well as being the gateway to many other beckoning lands, from Aegyptus to Syria.</p><p>Create a city on the Lycian coast.  I expect you to achieve levels of culture and prosperity beyond what you've done so far.  The peoples of the East must clearly see the benefits of Roman rule.</p><p>One small obstacle is the lack of farmland in this province.  However, Miletus affairs Roman citizens a new way to make a living.  At Miletus, you will pioneer fishing.</p><p>Romans have always been hesitant mariners.  Although we do set sail to conquer overseas enemies and spread our Empire to far shores, we Romans prefer to keep our feet dry.  No Roman city has ever fished for its food on a large scale.</p><p>You will change that.  Miletus has abundant fishing grounds.  You can spot them by the sea birds circulating overhead.</p><p>Build a shipyard to construct fishing boats.  </p><p>Fishing boats do not work out of the shipyard.  To provide crews and to process their cargoes, build wharves.  One wharf can serve only one fishing boat, so you must build a new wharf for every new fishing vessel that your shipyard builds.</p><p>Wharf workers will take fish to the granary, where it can be distributed just like any other food.</p><p>Oh by the way: I said that this is a peaceful province, but 'peaceful' is a relative term when you get this far away from Rome.  You should be ready for trouble. Pay attention to any reports of enemy activity, and be ready to defend your city.

You have governed long enough, now, to understand the dire results of a lack of food.</p><p>Thus, I am speeding up our colonisation of the new province of Hispania.  Imperial surveyors report finding a valley with ample farmland and good river access for seaborne trade.  Build a farming colony there, and be prepared to ship food back to Italia.</p><p>As always I will rate your performance, and this time I have modest expectations for you.  Although your city need not house as many people as the last one you built, it should be more prosperous, and should achieve better culture.  To reflect my increased reliance on you, I expect you to earn more favour with me as well.  I will require frequent shipments of food, and will look favourably upon you if you fulfil these requests in a timely fashion.</p><p>Many lives depend on your success at opening this new food source for the empire.  There is no military threat in Tarraco.

They can also become angry if they fell your city is large enough that there should be more temples altogether, so treat them carefully.  Consult your Religious Advisor to see what the gods think of you.  Lightning bolts there are an indication of a god's desire to punish your city.

				"content_text": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Here at MacRetro we are avid MacOS converts, but we spent much of our youth playing classic DOS and windows games, and still enjoy playing those classics from the 90s and 00s today.  We started MacRetro as a way of showing others how to make classic Windows games work on modern Apple architecture.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Until recently our preferred way of running classic Windows games was using the windows emulator WINE through the PlayOnMac emulator.  Unfortunately the introduction of macOS Catalina removed support for 32bit applications, rendering PlayonMac and WINE useless.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We have also dabbled with commercial solution Crossover, which is also run on WINE.  However, Crossover was also not ready for the introduction of Catalina, with Dreamweavers currently busy working on a solution.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One solution would be to not upgrade to macOS Catalina.  However, our philosophy is around making old games work on new technology, and is not about holding development back to play old games.  Also PlayOnMac and Crossover are not perfect solutions - many games will work, but not everything will.  It was possible for instance to install Championship Manager 01/02 in WINE - but not to run many of the patches that the community have put so much time into maintaining the game.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Our solution is not free, like PlayOnMac - but it does work much universally.  We are yet to find a game from the era that we cannot run.  We decided to build a virtual Windows XP virtual machine.  There are many pieces of software that you could do this in.  We opted for Parallels Desktop Pro, and then Parallels Desktop Lite.  There is very little cost or functional difference between the two - but Lite can be purchased through the App Store, and that allows us to run virtual machines on multiple computers from a single subscription.  This costs around ¬£70/year.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Other options to build your Windows XP Virtual Machine include VMWare Fusion and Desktop (not tested), which attract a similar cost to above, and VirtualBox, which does not.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So theoretically it is possible to implement this solution at nil cost too - though much more customisation is needed with the Virtual Box install that the Parallels installation assistant does out of the box.  We could make this work in Virtual Box - but nowhere near as well.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The first thing that you need to do, is to head across to the App Store and download a copy of Parallels Desktop Lite, or otherwise your virtualisation software of choice.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Once you have installed Parallels and selected the free trial (or entered your account details) you will be presented with the installation assistant.  Select to install Windows from an image file.  You will need to have a windows XP installation iso or CD.  You cannot buy XP from Microsoft as it is no longer supported.

Read on to find out how we got Championship Manager 01/02 working, all over again!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A couple of years ago we worked out how to get CM0102 working on Mac using PlayOnMac and Wine, with a little manual tinkering.  This was an excellent solution as it was lean, fast, and importantly, free.  With the advent of MacOS Catalina this solution stopped working, as did the commercial WINE wrapper Crossover.  WINE is unlikely to be ready for full 64 bit support for quite sometime, Crossover may have a workaround in early 2020.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Here at MacRetro retro gaming is pretty much the only kind of gaming that we do, and although we do have a linux gaming machine in the house, playing on the tower both defeats the purpose of this domain, and doesn't travel well either!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So we looked at the horizon, decided that there would not be a viable solution any time soon, so we came up with a new one.  First we tried to run  PlayOnMac inside a Linux Mint Virtual Machine.  Not only did CM0102 not work, neither did anything else we tried to run.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Next we decided to try to run games natively inside a Windows XP virtual machine on Mac, pretty much every game other than CM0102 worked - until we realised why CM0102 was not loading, and that it was something that we'd had to fix when running XP all those years ago too!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We looked at two different pieces of software to run this in - we looked at VMware and at Parallels.  We opted for the latter mainly because it has a nice and easy GUI to walk you through VM setup.  We are using \"Parallels Desktop Lite\" which you can purchase through the App Store.  It is more expensive than buying and renewing Parallels Destop Pro directly, but it does allow Parallels to be used on all of the machines in your apple account.  If that was not important to us (it is), we'd have bought the Pro application instead.  More detail on this another day.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So installing CM0102 in a Windows XP VM is pretty much the same as installing CM0102 on a windows XP machine way back then.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>Attach your CM0102.iso to the virtual CD ROM drive available in Parallels:</li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":1948,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/97910/2023/d87d68b84d.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1948\"/><figcaption>Mount your CM0102 ISO within Parallels.</figcaption></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>Select your installation language:</li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":1949,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/97910/2023/2a711a0b16.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1949\"/><figcaption>CM0102 installer</figcaption></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>Watch your game install</li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":1950,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/97910/2023/1b90d2eea4.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1950\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>Right Click (or centre click) on CM0102 icon on desktop, and load the properties menu.</li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":1951,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/97910/2023/f048bbcf66.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1951\"/><figcaption>Load CM0102 properties menu.</figcaption></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>Select the \"Compatibility\" tab in the dialogue box that loads:</li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":1952,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/97910/2023/ac3c7fd46d.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1952\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>CM0102 will not load in Windows XP - set compatibility mode to Windows 95</li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":1953,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/97910/2023/7e128bb93e.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1953\"/><figcaption>CM0102 Compatibility Mode</figcaption></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>Play CM0102 on your MacOS Catalina Machine!</li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":1954,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/97910/2023/efa0676cc6.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1954\"/><figcaption>CM0102 on MacOS Catalina</figcaption></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This is not the cheapest way of playing old windows games on Mac, and it is certainly not free.

The picture is stable, and filmed from bicycle, which provides for realistic traffic speed.  There is some slight judder to the picture at points, which makes the ride feel more realistic.

I just took a couple of quick photos of the park, having not been prior.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Arriving at the start line in front of Towneley Hall, I headed toward the back of the pack, as my plan was to run a steady 5km , and I expected to be running at closer to 6min/km than 05:30min/km pace.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The Towneley Park course consists of two figure of eight loops of a couple of fields in the park.  The length of the route is fairly flat, but the sides climb up to  the top of the route.  There is only really one noticeable climb, and two downhills given the contour.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I had settled in too far back in the pack, and given the size of the crowd it took a few minutes to get running at a coinsistent stride and pace.  I felt my diaphragm tighten a little on the first lap.  My asthma felt under control, so presumably that was a wee leftover from this winter's chest infection.  In any case I eased back, it passed, and I was able to run at my own pace for the remainder of the race.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Towards the end of the first lap I could see my average pace sitting around the 5:50min/km mark, and it did start to head south a little on the first climb back up to Towneley Hall.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I was fairly happy with 5:50min/km in the context - I knew I was going to get a big personal worst for 5km today.  I would have liked to get under 5:45min/km though, and so pressed a little harder on the second lap as the field thinned, and especially down the last downhill and finishing straight.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I crossed the finishing line in 28:23, averaging 5:36/km (this course measured slightly long on my watch) - and that is at home alongside my fastest runs since March/April - so I'm incredibly happy with that - and it also includes a decent amount of walking at the beginning.  I wasn't pushing  particularly hard for most of this run - it was deliberately RPE1/2 in the main.  The official time is slightly longer at 28:41, which presumably includes some of the time waiting for tags to be scanned  on the mats.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There is a cafe in the car park that many of the other participants were using - but I headed straight back, having exhausted my bank holiday morning out pass!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:html -->\n<iframe height=\"405\" width=\"590\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://www.strava.com/activities/2047960954/embed/507f1275d44abbe62210b5cc38a1861c6c1b7a67\"></iframe>\n<!-- /wp:html -->\n",

As a result, an effective health and safety practitioner is a very versatile creature with much variety in their role.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Key tasks in the health and safety role might include:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>Writing policies and procedures</li><li>Assessing risks</li><li>Investigating accidents</li><li>Advising managers and directors</li><li>Consulting with employees</li><li>Training</li><li>Managing Contractors</li><li>Liaising with third parties including auditors, regulators and insurers</li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>To be able to complete all these functions properly health and safety practitioners need a broad range of transferrable skills, they need to be able to:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>Communicate effectively</li><li>Maintain their independence</li><li>Work at all levels of the organisations they work within</li><li>Organise their workload</li><li>Prioritise</li><li>Delegate</li><li>Maintain their own competence.</li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It is very rare these days that the health and safety function in an organisation sit in isolation. Other roles often combined with the Health and safety function include:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>Environmental Management</li><li>Quality Management</li><li>Security</li><li>Training</li><li>Food Safety</li><li>Transport</li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>leading to the creation of the HSEQ Manager, HSET Manager, QHSE Manager, SHEQ Manager, HSE & Compliance Manager and so on - all dependent upon the priorities of the organisations they work for. The point being that every health and safety role is different, (and very often every day is different too!) and that health and safety professionals often need to adapt and upskill to accept other requirements in to their role.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It should also be noted that occupational health and safety covers a broad range of more specialist areas, which we will touch on in more detail later on. While the general health and safety practitioner does not need to know everything about these specialisms, they do need an overview and broad understanding of what they are and their application. Such specialisms include:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>occupational healthwhich is primarily concerned with monitoring individuals for the onset of disease and ill-health arising from exposure to hazards</li><li>occupational hygieneprimarily concerned with examining and controlling individual exposure to dangerous substances that can cause ill-health.</li><li>ergonomicswhich is a field concerned with ensuring that the work process is designed to be aligned to the individual and thereby reducing the likelihood of human error.</li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:separator -->\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n<!-- /wp:separator -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 id=\"barriers-to-good-standards-of-health-and-safety\">Barriers to Good Standards of Health and Safety</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 id=\"complexity\">Complexity</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We have already seen that the health and safety profession is one that has broad boundaries, is challenging and has a range of specialist areas within it. Health and safety professionals are usually generalists who need to know a broad subject area in great depth, but who also cannot be expected to know everything about a field as complex as ergonomics for instance. This poses one of the great challenges for health and safety professionals - knowing the limits of our competence, and when to seek expert support.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Sometimes the measures that need to be implemented can be complex too, which can result in items lading in the¬†<em>too difficult</em>¬†pile. An organisation might identify the need to implement improvements to the traffic movements on their site - but the wholesale rearrangement of the site may make this too big or complex a project to realise expediently.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Finally, that level of complexity can make it difficult for others to understand why something that seems obtrusive is necessary and to implement it properly. An example might be the correct use of extraction for welding processes, the equipment is bulky, and heavy, and can be perceived as getting in the way - explaining that the fume it is extracting might contain substances like nickel that can cause skin and lung conditions in the future, can seem a bit of a stretch to those with little understanding of occupational hygiene. It is almost always easier to convince people of the need to take measures to protect their safety, with hazards that are often visual and obvious, than it is their health.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 id=\"competing-and-conflicting-demands\">Competing and conflicting demands,</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Health and safety do not sit in isolation in an organisation, and therefore it is subject to the same challenges that other disciplines face.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Production is almost always king in a production environment. That poses a number of challenges:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>Short cuts, bypassing safety measures</li><li>Releasing employees for training</li><li>Releasing safety representatives to fulfil their duties</li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Often health and safety improvement programmes will come with a capital costs that competes with other functions for the finite resources that the organisation has at its disposal, and arguably conflicts with the organisation‚Äôs short-term desire for profit.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Time can be problematic too. It is rare for health and safety to stand in isolation within an organisation. The modern health and safety professional will often have competing demands from their other responsibilities including environmental and quality management and more generally surviving the audit hamster wheel. Time is also an issue finite for everybody else in an organisation.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>All of this should be put into context when designing solutions to health and safety problems - systems that are disproportionately costly, complex and unwieldly are unlikely to succeed for this reason.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 id=\"behavioural-issues\">Behavioural issues</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Even the best designed and resourced health and safety management systems still require people to implement them. While this should not pose a problem for organisations with strong health and safety cultures, compliance will be more problematic where the culture is less strong.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Common reasons for disregarding health and safety systems include:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>perceived inefficiency</li><li>peer pressure</li><li>custom and practice elsewhere in the organisation</li><li>top management set a contradictory example</li><li>misperception of level of risk</li><li>overfamiliarity with process / equipment</li><li>lack of training</li><li>lack of supervision and reinforcement</li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:separator -->\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n<!-- /wp:separator -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 id=\"key-definitions\">Key Definitions</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We conclude this introduction to health and safety management by defining some of the underpinning terms in the health and safety profession - health, safety, and welfare. When we move on to look at the requirements of health and safety law later on in this course we will see that employers are required to take measures to protect the health, safety¬†<em>and</em>¬†welfare of their employees - what do these words mean, and how do they interact with and differ from one another?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 id=\"health\">Health</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When as health and safety professionals we talk about health we are usually talking about keeping employees are others free from ill-health or disease. Usually we are concerned with exposure to chemical, biological and psychosocial factors that can make people unwell. This is in contrast to safety which is usually concerned with exposure to physical hazards that cause physical injury.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One of the mistake health and safety professionals tend to make is not paying adequate attention to occupational health. In part this is due to latency - often ill-health following exposure can cause many months or years to manifest, exposure to asbestos for instance can take 40 years or more to result in mesothelioma. Health hazards can be more difficult to see and identify too.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 id=\"safety\">Safety</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When talking about safety, occupational health and safety professionals are usually talking about keeping employees and others free from physical injury. Unlike health hazards safety hazards are usually very immediate, often apparent, and are also often easier to explain the significance to others such as managers, directors and employees. It is often easier to convince an employer that they need to provide a guard to a piece of machinery, than it is to convince them that they need to better control exposure to substances such as wood dust for instance.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Notwithstanding any of the above it should be noted that significantly more people are killed in the UK each year through historic exposure to dangerous substances than are killed in an accident at work.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 id=\"welfare\">Welfare</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When we talk about welfare, we are usually talking about the provision of facilities in the workplace for employees. We might be referring to the provision of toilet and washing facilities, of first aid facilities, of places to eat and drink. We might also be talking about maintaining the environment in the workplace at comfortable temperatures.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>While welfare is about provision of facilities and a comfortable working environment, it should be noted that welfare has the ability to impact on both safety and health. Employees that cannot wash their hands properly before eating, for instance, are more likely to ingest the dangerous substance that they work with and suffer ill health. Employees who are too hot or cold, or with poor lighting are more likely to have accidents in the workplace, impacting on safety.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 id=\"summary\">Summary</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In this first lesson of our walkthrough of the NEBOSH NGC1 ‚ÄòManagement of Health and Safety‚Äô module we looked at the complexity of the modern health and safety professional‚Äôs role, along with some of the other disciplines it tends to come with. We also looked at some of the barriers to achieving good health and safety management. We concluded by looking at definitions of some of the defining terms in the health and safety field - health, safety and welfare.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

				"content_text": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Winter 2017-18 has presented a sequence of challenges that have made consistent training very difficult, and left me relying on the key weekend routines to maintain any semblance of a routine. The key challenges have been two-fold, firstly my typical working week has been ridiculously long and busy, though succesful and rewarding, leaving little energy midweek. In addition to which my wife has worked away midweek since September, making midweek training very difficult combined with managing four (loud) canine children in an urban area of Doncaster.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There have been some positives though. Weekend training, though light, has been consistent and has been ramping up towards the end of February, start of March despite 'winter' striking rather late this year. In addition to which it has been a winter free from chest infection and where my asthma has remained largely under control - though this has little to do with anything I've done.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This last weekend has been particularly impressive. The week was as usual completely devoid of any running, and despite best intentions any prospect of a Friday evening run was cut out by finishing time, daylight and underfoot conditions. If anything the latter made the prospect of any running this weekend look unlikely.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I did manage to get two runs in though, a calf bursting run in spikes on the Saturday, struggling to find enough ice to run on, but certainly not enough pavement to run in flats. The Sunday run couldn't have gone better, I found myself at the top of the route in Armthoroe around 10sec/km faster than usual, and just pulled even further away all the way down, without especially trying to, culminating in attacking the last 2km home. I've no idea where that run came from - but a couple of segment PRs fell that I have run many times before each.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There is light at the end of the tunnel though. Hopefully in the not too distant future we will all live together where we work - although a week or so may be lost completely in any move. This is the healthiest, lightest, and arguably the fastest I've come through winter in the last 3 years or so. The endurance is not there yet, running marathon distance competitively in May looks unlikely - so much so that I'll be changing my Liverpool Rock'n Roll entry to half distance, but a distance I'm looking fairly well placed to attack at the moment.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So although winter 2017-18 has been a very tough training season for a variety of reasons, it has not been the complete capitulation that previous winters have been, and I'm entering spring in pretty good shape. I just need to identify a warm fast marathon towards the end of the season to build the year around.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:html -->\n<iframe height='405' width='590' frameborder='0' allowtransparency='true' scrolling='no' src='https://www.strava.com/activities/1435823700/embed/f899460d48bc3f06c89d739ce522daf25921afb9'></iframe>\n<!-- /wp:html -->\n",

A big chest infection in the winter followed by ongoing problems with asthma meant that I barely run until May, and work commitments made it pretty difficult to get into any sort of rhythm until a change of job at the start of July. By which point I'd long discarded any hope of running at the Skiddaw race and had instead picked the Dublin Marathon as my A Race, and my only race, for the year.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Fortunately work eased off through July and August, and I managed to get a good couple of months training together before work ramped up again with a vengeance in September knocking the rhythm that I had been building up midweek, but not stopping me getting out for the long runs at the weekend.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Dublin Marathon weekend arrived pretty quickly. I hadn't got up to the distance that I had wanted in training, and I probably wasn't carrying the speed that I wanted to either - but I was pretty sure that I could still come in below the time I had achieved in London (4h26) and in Barcelona (3h55). My race strategy was based on a 14:1 run:walk interval similar to which I had employed in Barcelona, and using the 15th minute to fuel and drink.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The strategy seemed to be working pretty well early in the race. Heading through Phoenix Park I was maintaining an overall average under 5:40/km and I only needed to maintain a run average of 5:35-5:40km, so I was definitely banking a little time. So far so good. It did get pretty hot in the sun in the park, which wasn't really forecast, but I was taking in fluid so I wasn't especially concerned.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The wheels started to come off approaching halfway, and I was struggling a little more to easily maintain the pace that I had started with - which of itself isn't especially fast. I saw Vickie at half way and she gave me some flat coke. Straight out of the ultra-marathon playbook. I knew I was in for a long afternoon at this point and said as much.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I had been battling something in the left groin to lift that leg for a couple of km, and around a couple of km after half way my right hamstrings cramped up and I was stationary on the floor for a couple of minutes, and then walked for a couple of minutes, before managing to run on for perhaps the next 20 - 30 min. Eventually though I came to a point where I couldn't really run anymore. I decided to walk it out until I met Vickie and could get my coat, but she never appeared!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After getting pretty cold and miserable, and not to forget almost being demolished a couple of times by the waves of people clung to pacers for grim death as they came past, I picked up my pace and got up to around 8:30/km which is pretty nifty as walking goes.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I could see that it was touch and go that I could still come in under 5h, and I was pretty determined that I was going to do so. In addition to which all of the uphill had now disappeared, and I should have mentioned that this is a pretty hilly course for a road marathon - at least compared to London and Barcelona, so I was able to make use of the downhill to trot to gain a few minutes.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I didn't really want to run over the line, it felt a bit fraudulent having walked about a third of the route, but someone gave me a kick up the erse on the finish line so I opened my stride out and gave it some lalldy over the finish line - but paid for that the following day. I came in at around 4:56 in the end. A second personal worst in as many days, but I was a little less proud of this one!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>With retrospect post race my right ITB especially was pretty grim and there was some knotting up on the peroneal tendon on the left, as well as the cramp damage on the left hammies. The volume of work wasn't there, and the ramp probably came too late and coincided with a time where I wasn't getting in my midweek runs to stretch everything out between big runs. So while I was disappointed with the outcome, your body doesn't lie in a Marathon. I pretty much got what I deserved - but thats not to take anything away from the level of improvement since April when I could not even run a 1km interval. So the key lesson that I need to take from this is to stay on top of my asthma through the winter so that I do not find myself in that position again next year, and to already have the distance and speed in my legs and to have lost more weight in the interim.

Click the New button at the bottom left, which should open up a wizard. Click Next, select the system version of wine on the next screen, and click next again. Next call the drive whatever you want to, click next one last time, and your virtual environment is created.\n\nNext we need to install CM01/02. Your new drive should have appeared on the left hand side of the configure screen in PlayOnMac/Linux. Select it; and choose the miscellaneous tab to the top right. On that tab select the option run a windows executable in this virtual drive. From there navigate to the CM01/02 iso that you have mounted and select the install executable, CM01/02 will install. If you have any patches to apply to the game then you can do that the same way.\n\nOnce you have installed the game switch from the miscellaneous tab of the virtual drive to the general tab. Select the \"Make new shortcut from this virtual drive\" button. This should identify the CM01/02 executables - install a shortcut to the game now.\n\nYou can now close the configure tab, and the shortcuts you have just added will be present in PlayOnMac/Linux - double click on one and the game will run. Remember to mount the CM01/02 iso before playing next time too.\n",

I entered into the Speyside Way Race to counter this, fairly sure that I could challenge towards the top 10 of the field, but a Compylobacter infection followed by a whole series of arthritic complications meant that I did not run in August at all, did not start the race, and am just now into my second week of a light return to training. This also meant that I had to miss the St. Mary‚Äôs Loch standard tri at the start of September as I just didn‚Äôt have any strength in my legs, or enough open water swimming under my belt.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So I am back training now, my run pace is probably around 30 sec/km away from where I want it to be for the faster stuff, but endurance pace seems to still be in the right place, maybe 10 sec/km down. I‚Äôm maybe 1km/hr slower on the bike than a month ago, but more significantly struggling to ride beyond the hour. Swim feels fine, if slightly laboured.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So, whats left? There is the Jedburgh 3 Peaks race at the end of October. Touch wood I think I‚Äôm in decent shape for that with endurance pace where it needs to be, and weight down.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>2015 will open with a crack at the Dusseld√∂rf Marathon where I will be aiming to get under 3:15. This would be a significant 40min reduction in PB, but reflects how I was running in training earlier in the summer. I also intend to eat vast quantities of Curryw√ºrst and pretzels.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I do have to thank Karl for getting me into pretty decent shape this year and Tommy for keeping me there when I‚Äôve pushed past my limits. It‚Äôs a shame that has not been reflected in my results, but the improvements in training session data are pretty plain to see.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Lets hope that I can polish off 2014 with a good run at Jedburgh, that I get a good warm weather winter session in again, and have a more settled and less broken 2015.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

				"content_text": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After collecting Vickie from Edinburgh Airport on Friday we made our way across to Milngavie for the start of the Highland Fling Race. Avoiding the Edinburgh traffic, and upsetting a taxi driver in the process by purchasing croissants as well as diesel, we probably arrived at the Premier Inn at Bearsden where we were staying, and where by coincidence the race registration was taking place and the incrowd gathering. I registered, and we ate ok food rather later than I would have liked.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Stepping back a little I had not been particularly enthusiastic about this race. I thought that my endurance work was a little on the light side, and seemed to have spent the previous 8 weeks or so juggling life‚Äôs little obstacles. Training had been going well though, I just wasn‚Äôt sure that I‚Äôd done enough. My spirits were lifted though by a decent triathlon debut at Galashiels the weekend before. Coach Karl had also sidestepped any such intimations and made it pretty clear that I was ready. The pre race week was still manic though, with juggling assignments, tutorials, training and so forth, but I started to believe.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I left Vickie in bed at around 5am to join the procession of runners walking through Milngavie to the race start. Karl had come up with a nifty little race plan which broadly involved keeping my heart rate within the 160 ‚Äì 165 bpm range. I‚Äôd never really even done much training using HR data, except recently in the altitude chamber at Napier Uni, and on the odd run here and there for data. However it made sense, as for the distance of race you do want to be working aerobically for as much as possible, and I was happy to go with it. My only concerns were that my anaerobic threshold is not particularly fast, and that wearing the monitor for so long would cause chafing. Cue a 10pm visit to Milngavie‚Äôs global capitalist presence to procure some Vaseline.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Arriving at the start I pretty much kept myself to myself, but spotted most of the celebs of the Scottish ultra running blogosphere including RedWineRunner, MedalSlut and Keith Ainslie, having a brief chat with Fiona Rennie and then Norry. Look them up, their blogs are far better than mine, and certainly Rachel and Rhona have written good reports of the race. I‚Äôll add links in when I‚Äôm on a PC again.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Holding back in the pack at the start of the race, I felt that I would probably sit there up until about marathon distance before picking my way through the field. The plan was to finish in 11:30, all of the early running suggested that this was certainly achievable if not beatable, and the weather was very runnable despite the apocalyptic forecasts.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The first stretch out to Drymen is not strictly speaking flat, there is plenty of up and down even there, but I soon settled into a rhythm averaging 11 minute miles, including taking food every 30 minutes. I would spend much of this time to and froing with Fiona before pulling away into Drymen. Coming into Drymen I was feeling pretty comfortable, and in control, I didn‚Äôt have any doubt that I could finish, and that I was going to finish well. As they sad, pride comes before the fall.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After climbing briefly from Drymen the route drops to a plateau that you run along until you come to Conic Hill. On that first descent I started to make my way through a condensed field quite quickly, as I had done a few times earlier on. Coming upto a group of around 4 people I kicked a rock sending my head forwards, and putting my centre of gravity forward of the hips. I was still descending quite quickly at this point, and tried to regain my balance over 4 ‚Äì 5 steps, but I couldn‚Äôt pull it back. Ordinarily I would have tried to outrun the fall, but I had nowhere to go. I went down heavily on my left shoulder, grazing hands and arms, before feeling the sickening thud of my head striking the track.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I looked up to a group of 4 or 5 people who were around me, helped me with drink and food, and helped me to get up and carry on. I ran with Tim Downie over Conic Hill, and while I don‚Äôt think that I was holding him up, was grateful to have somebody to run with and have some company at this point. I was pretty shook up. I wasn‚Äôt too worried about the blood everywhere, but I didn‚Äôt like the headache much. That said it did wane on this section, and the running on this section was probably better than even the section out to Drymen. Guys and girls, thanks for your help.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I stopped at Balmaha to get everything cleaned up by the first aiders from Ayrshire with lovely Newfoundlands. Again I have to thank the first aiders here and at Rowardennan for looking after me. I felt pretty rough on leaving, and by the time I ran past Dave Kiddell on the shore of Loch Lomond I knew that I would probably be terminating at Rowardennan. I slowed down, sticking for a bit with a lady who was struggling to keep food down, and tried to make the trot to the next checkpoint as comfortable as I could.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I immediately withdrew on arriving, and wanted to get off to hospital ASAP. My very worried wife was able to collect me a little while later and escort me there, and I felt extremely nauseous all the way to Kirkcaldy. I also have to thank her for looking after me, and similarly all the nice doctors and nurses who turned me around pretty quickly. hopefully my strava data is below, if not i will add it in properly on pc later.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The good news is that there are no visible breaks on the X-ray, and nothing seems to have gone wrong with the head in the few days since, so far so good. I seem to have a very nasty left shoulder sprain, with rotation for swim presently impossible, as is any loading of it. I‚Äôm hoping to be back in the pool shortly, and to be ready for Aberfeldy sprint tri in 4 weeks time, but we really will have to see how it goes.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I‚Äôm probably not best placed to lecture anybody on running given the calamity above so i will keep my observations brief. I have always known that running uphill generally doesn‚Äôt happen much from the mid-field backwards in ultra distance races. I was surprised though by how little use is made of gravity in running downhill. It‚Äôs free speed, take it, just don‚Äôt mash your quads in doing so. I was slightly less amazed by the plethora of highly branded technical kit surrounding me in the midfield. I don‚Äôt think that there is much need for most of this. I wear compression gear for recovery, I very rarely race in it, and quit frankly I couldn‚Äôt give a toss what logo is on it. The point that I‚Äôm trying to make, badly, is that if you have money to burn in ultra running, and are looking to use it to improve performance, spend it on a having a good coach sorting out your running technique and putting some structure into your training, because you will see very real improvements not just to your times, but also to the amount of the year you spend injury free. That‚Äôs certainly true of the year or so now that I have been working with Karl Zeiner. It‚Äôs not really about how many miles you can bang out in training, but arriving at the start line ready to race. Feel free to ignore my ramblings as you will.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:html -->\n<iframe height='405' width='590' frameborder='0' allowtransparency='true' scrolling='no' src='https://www.strava.com/activities/134835566/embed/2550445da8de0ccd6526b090acbd8cf31eda489f'></iframe>\n<!-- /wp:html -->\n",

This changed a little in the aftermath of the Barcelona Marathon when I decided that I also wanted to improve my speedwork, and to get faster, and more competitive at what I have been doing. This combined with the likely unfeasibility of the Ultima Frontera 168 in October due to our current work circumstances (See my wife Vickie‚Äôs awesome bloggage for an idea of the manicness) to present an opportunity to do so.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I had perceived, as anecdotally most aspirant triathletes seem to, that the swim was my biggest obstacle to doing so, particularly given that I hadn‚Äôt swum crawl since school. I have been working on this with Karl since around October, and he has done some good work in getting me to a point where I now have a sort of efficient swim stroke which I can hold onto without drowning for a wee while at least.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So I joined my local triathlon club, signed up for my race licence from Triathlon Scotland and committed to a bunch of races to see how things went.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The first race that I had entered was the Galashiels Novice Triathlon. I entered the novice event as the primary purpose was to get a feel for how transition worked, and also not to overcommit myself in terms of swimming.

				"content_text": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Running in the sun has never really been my strength, and so it was with some trepidation that I flew into Barcelona on the Wednesday prior to the Marathon, hoping that I would hold it together in the warmer weather.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Fortunately I had taken the opportunity to spend 3 weeks warm weather training in Valenciana over the festive break, and a weekend in tropical Paris the weekend before the race had also helped me to acclimatise somewhat.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Arriving in Barcelona early on Wednesday afternoon I had some time free, and nothing to do with it as I had finished all my LLB work and left it in the truck at Newcastle airport, and was not collecting Vickie from the airport until around 9pm. So I went for a wee run down to the beach and back:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Although it was hot and sunny I enjoyed this little run, and wasn‚Äôt overly bothered by the weather despite not taking any water out with me.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The following day I decided to throw a little hillwork into the mix and headed up towards Park Guell, which I failed to find, and also could not find la Sagrada Familia on my way back to the hotel. If you have never been to Barcelona, believe me, its a pretty big building to lose:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>My final warm up run was around Park Guell, which I was pretty sad to discover now contains a capitalist enclave which you have to pay to get into. In any case I did some hillwork, and then struggled to find my wife:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Before I knew where it had come from, it was race day, and a cool 25C. In the autumn I had been routinely banging out low 7 minute miles in training and felt that at Barcelona I would be able to push towards 3h30, which would have been an improvement on my London PR of around an hour.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A bad winter with quad issues and asthma had slowed me down considerably, and so Karl‚Äôs plan for Barcelona was to run:walk 14:1, hopefully keep the average mile pace below 9 minute miles, stay under 4 hours, and hopefully kick towards the end for a negative split.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Most of the climb on the Barcelona route is in the first 5 or 6 miles as you climb up towards the Nou Camp. In my enthusiasm at entry time I again found myself in the 3:15 to 3:30 pen, which mean that the field went flying past as I reined my pace in on those early miles. I also managed to spot Vickie in the crowd on this uphill section. I think that most other competitors were somewhat bemused by my run walk strategy, and I got the odd look of concern as I tucked into my cereal bar.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>At around mile 6 the course begins to drop back down towards the sea, and I put in a sub 8 minute mile here which brought my average pace down towards 8:40, giving me some good margin to play with below my target for the rest of the race.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>For large tracts of the remainder of the race I sat around the high 8 minute and low 9 minute per mile mark taking in the sights, keeping an eye out for Vickie who I did not see, and trying to generally keep my core temperature under control. I was generally faster than those around me, overtaking, only to have to overtake many of the same people after each walk break.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>At around mile 20 much of the field around me seemed to hit the wall, and just randomly stop. I decided to kick, putting in miles of 8:35, 8:54 (inc walk) and an especially pleasing uphill 8:07 for mile 22, and it was around here that I spotted Vickie again near the Arch of Catalunyan Triumphs. This wee section effectively guaranteed a sub-4 finish, but the sun was getting hotter, and I was needing to take on more and more water, and dip my cap in the ice buckets more. I reeled the pace back in towards the low 9 minute miles, part by choice, part because overtaking in the field became increasing treacherous and then almost impossible as the field around me gradually ground to a halt.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Eventually the finish line appeared, I really kicked on, overtaking what seemed like several people with each step, almost everybody seemed to be walking by this point. Another couple of finishing lines appeared around the corner which I carried decent pace through of high 6 to high 7 minute miles, giving me a small negative split of around a minute, finishing in a new PR of 3:55:49.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I‚Äôm very happy with the performance, it was not what I envisaged when I entered, but it was equally far better than I had hoped for just a couple of weeks earlier. One change that I made in the three days in Barcelona was to switch back out of my comfy road shoes into a pair of INOV8 FLites. I did this because I felt that I had been struggling for good form while running. This made my calves work far harder during those last runs and the race, but my form was better, any heel strike had gone, and as a result I did not mash my quads. I also have to be pleased with my performance in the sun and the heat, to some degree that exorcised a few ghosts from races past.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The verdict: I‚Äôm afraid that I much prefer the Barcelona race to London. With 36,000 athletes this is still a big city marathon, the crowd was good, but not as overbearing as at London, which if I‚Äôm being blatantly honest I found to be claustrophobic, loud, overly personal and insincere, a bit like going to the circus. I think that London is a race that everybody should experience once, I have, I‚Äôm glad that I did, but I‚Äôve no real desire to go back. So next year I will again not be applying in the London ballot, I‚Äôm probably heading to D√ºsseldorf instead for another big city marathon in a city that a love running in and on a route much of which I fell in love with back in September.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:html -->\n<iframe height='405' width='590' frameborder='0' allowtransparency='true' scrolling='no' src='https://www.strava.com/activities/121600490/embed/b5a9c829f4ef9eca4b2dacc5b5a1ae6c30d5ab61'></iframe>\n<!-- /wp:html -->\n",

I was not surprised to be ultimately diagnosed with exercise acquired asthma. ¬†After all, the medication that had fixed my previous episode was not the antibiotics prescribed, but Salbutamol, an asthma reliever, which had also proved quite handy at allowing me to breathe after to 2012 edition.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Training started quite slowly, despite having obtained a ballot place in the London Marathon, and didn&rsquo;t really get going much until February. ¬†Towards the start of the month I met up with my revolutionary new running buddies from the dark side of Kintore, hill repping away as much as my chest would permit. ¬†Later in the month I arrived in Vietnam where, warm and dry, I put away a considerable number of miles on various air conditioned treadmills while also getting in a memorable road run out to and along the beach at Hoi An.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Vietnam treadmilling had put me back in better shape, although returning home at about 13st 4lb I was still far too heavy. ¬†Training continued pretty well on my return to Aboyne up until the London Mararthon, not as quick as maybe I had run previously at times, but fairly solid.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Around a week before the London Marathon I engaged <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Karl Zeiner<!-- raw HTML omitted -->¬†to coach me, and i&rsquo;ll come back onto this a little later. ¬†Obvoiusly in the five days pre-London there was very little that Karl could do to influence that race other than to provide some reassurance based upon the data I had managed to get into Strava at that point. ¬†Our race plan was broadly to head out at 9 min/mi aiming to still be under 10 min/mi by the end of the race and broadly I slipped a little from this, but not too much, coming home in around 4:25:00 on a day that I found to be quite hot.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Getting back from London my next ultra, the Cateran Trail was just 4 weeks away and at 55 miles was always going to be a tough ask given the previous 18 months. ¬†Training went really well though up to the race, and although it was always going to be tough, and I wouldn&rsquo;t be setting any records, I thought that I could finish it.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Cateran race started ok, but I always felt more laboured than normal, but I headed through the first checkpoint at Dalnagair Castle just about on plan. ¬†The road section after here I took pretty quickly, and felt quite good, although on hitting the trail it began to become apparent that I was overheating and feeling nauseous, symptoms I recognised from previous accidents involving heavy handedness and electrolytes. ¬†I dropped into CP at Kirtkton of Glenisla about on time, but feeling pretty rough, and continued on after a pretty disjointed hydration bladder refill in which I could not get the cap back on properly. ¬†I felt even rougher heading on out and up the hill and decided there and then that I would be dropping out at Alyth, none of the prolonged debating with myself which I had gone on to ignore in previous races. ¬†I had replaced my electrolyte with largely water at Kirkton of Glenisla, and although I began to feel better on the drop into Alyth the weather began to worsen, and I didn&rsquo;t really fancy a long slog in the rain and wind. ¬†So in short, although I&rsquo;d had a pretty rough and unfortunate start to the race, the main reason that I did drop out was that my head wasn&rsquo;t in it. ¬†A bad day at the office, and my first DNF.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I had a couple of months until my next race which would be the Clyde Stride Ultra at the start of July. ¬†Training continued to go well, and along with ongoing physiotherapy sessions, particularly on both tibiali, along with various attachments running into the right knee, I was quite optimistic going into the Clyde Stride, hoping to hold onto 10 min/mi throughout the race. ¬†I hopped on the train from my hotel in Milngavie down to Partick on what was a lovely morning. ¬†I hit the first leg of the race pretty hard, but I didn&rsquo;t feel too hard, but the middle section of the race from the first checkpoint, through Strathclyde Country Park particularly to the last checkpoint I found very hot, and very tough. ¬†The last leg was little short of a death march. ¬†There were some plusses from the race, in particular my fuelling and hydration strategies had gone very well. ¬†Ultimately I need to run better in hot weather, particularly with some of the races planned for 2014. ¬†My race placing too was much improved from previous races, but I couldn&rsquo;t help but be disappointed with my overall time, and my flirtation with heatstroke for most of an afternoon - despite my silly dessert hat.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The period after the Clyde Stride defined really the remainder of the year. ¬†A house move from Aboyne down to Dunfermline resulted in 3 weeks without training, in part due to 14 hour round trips in a van full of materialistic possessions, and followed by a less predicatable bout of infected bursitis in my left elbow brought on by manhandling bookcases. ¬†Ok. ¬†It was predictable.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The loss of training at the point put my key race for the year, the Ring o Fire, beyond reach I felt, and so I opted to grab a late entry into the Speyside Way Race from Ballindalloch into Buckie. ¬†Again hoping to hold onto around 10 min/mi I would fall slightly short of that, but overall the race was a big success, and but for a slow down between Fochabers and Spey Bay could have been so much better. ¬†I was pleased with the race, and with a strong kick at the finish, but also a little frustrated with myself for time lost in the latter stages of the race.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->My focus after Speyside turned towards hillrunning with the Pentland Skyline race pencilled in at the start of October. ¬†On the whole I enjoyed this, but my key goal for the remainder of the year was to run well at Glen Ogle at the start of November. ¬†My goals for the skyline race were limited, and I missed my target by about half an hour. ¬†Given the bad weather this would probably have been acceptable except that again it should have been so much better. ¬†On this occasion I got my fuelling wrong, and bonked all the way up the final climbs losing oodles of time as a result. ¬†However, this was never a race that I was going to finish, and given a bug-riddled September was on that I had thought long and hard about whether to start. ¬†In the end I decided to man up.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I was not much better fortunate with wee bugs during October, and although when I was running I was running faster than I had ever run before and I was 1st 4lb lighter than at London, I was struggling to obtain the level of consistency that I had managed upto the Speyside Way Race. ¬†This was in part due to illness but also business commitments. ¬†So when Glen Ogle came around I knew that I could run fast, but was slightly pessimistic about how fast I would run. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The start of the Glen Ogle race went really well. ¬†I dropped out of the forest into Kingshouse well under my 10 min/mi target, and arrived at the checkpoint at the top of the glen similarly ahead of target, and gained even more time into the drop into the forest. ¬†I knew that I would lose a lot of time on the big hill at the back of the course, and so I wasn&rsquo;t too concerned to drop back to the 3rd checkpoint at 10:45 min/mi, knowing that the remainder of the course was downhill, and that I was planning to &lsquo;drop the hammer&rsquo;. ¬†Sadly the weather came in at this point and I lost any power in my quads on the descent, ultimately slipping to 11 min/mi. ¬†This was not the deathmarch finish of previous Glen Oglee 33&rsquo;s, but in reality the last 9 miles of the race was no real improvement either. ¬†I am disappointed with the overall result, but also recognise that a better September and October would have probably delivered the step change in result that I was looking for here. ¬†The result was a big improvement. ¬†But again I&rsquo;m frustrated because it could have been better.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Therein lies the dilemma then. ¬†In short I am disappointed because I have improved so much in training this year, but do not feel that my results show that yet, although on several occasions I&rsquo;ve been pretty close to delivering. ¬†Running the skyline race in October was probably a mistake ultimately, and probably prejudiced Glen Ogle, but I enjoyed the race and it fits well with some of the big mountain ultras that I am hoping to race in future. ¬†I also ran the hills at Glen Ogle far stronger than I have ever run them before - the time that I lost was on the downhill, and but for that my PB improvement would have been more like 1h30 than the 45min achieved.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->So, reflecting finally on what has driven my improvements through the year, there are 3 main factors - training, maintenance and nutrition.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Firstly, since I began working with Karl my training has a much more realistic but consistent edge to it. ¬†Yes I still do long runs, but I also do a lot more shorter stuff, hillwork and speedwork, and this has helped me to better condition myself heading into races, as has much more back to back work and double run / double discipline days. ¬†No longer is running about distance, its also about how well I can run that distance, and I hope that heading into 2014 we can replicate the gains made this year and translate them into the longer races planned in 2014. ¬†On a personal note I find Karl very knowledgeable and enthusiastic across the ultra endurance disciplines, realistic, pragmatic and adaptive in planning, and sufficiently scary to keep me training when I otherwise wouldn&rsquo;t.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->My maintenance strategy has been much more proactive, and I have gennerally booked physio sessions post-race as routine, as well as identifying niggles earlier and getting them fixed before they impacted upon training more generally. ¬†I have spent much of the year under the care of Richard Batho of Deeside Physiotherapy and Victoria Davidson although I also need to identify more local support having relocated to the central belt.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Finally, my wife Vickie has done a lot of work on my fuelling strategy helping to create (and cook) fantastic eloctrolytic flapjack which has helped to reduce my hydration problems since the Cateran Trail Race, as well as following me around and helping me at race weekend through the year, and this has also manifested itself in my slow but sustained move away from the bottom of the results table.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->2014 then starts early with a tilt at the Barcelona Marathon in March, where I expect to be substantially below 4 hours, followed by the Highland Fling Race, Devil o the Highlands and culminating with the Ultima Frontera 166 in Andalucia in October.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->As mine starts on 19 November 2013&hellip;<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->¬°<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Feliz A√±o Nuevo 2014<!-- raw HTML omitted -->!<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n",

				"content_text": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The Glen Ogle race had become my priority for the remainder of the year after cancelling my Ring o Fire entry. Given that the race had sold out in 53 minutes flat I also wanted to set a good time so that I didn‚Äôt have to worry about whether I actually entered in time or not in future, although this will not be an issue next year in any case given my alternative plans.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Similar to the Speyside Way Race, I wanted to run under 10 minute miles averaged through the race, and despite a rough couple of months with a recurring virus interrupting training I felt that I could achieve this. My goal was 5:30, but privately I wanted to run under 5 hours, and felt that I could do so.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I wont describe the route in any great detail, as I‚Äôve run this race twice before. The stretch out of the forest from Strathyre to Kingshouse went well, and I dropped into checkpoint 1 with my average page back down to around 9:45min/mi.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I ran strongly out to Lochearnhead and up the disused railway and over the Glen Ogle viaduct, possibly too strongly. I was conscious that this stretch was uphill, but I didn‚Äôt appreciate how high it actually climbed until looking at the Strava stats on the link below.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I dropped into the forest towards Killin very strongly, but was taken unwell towards the bottom of the hill where a pit stop was required. The climb back up to the top of the hill was slow, this was not where my race began to unravel though, I expected this, and would have accepted the 10:45min/mi average pace that I had when I resumed running out of CP3 a little while later. Before that though the weather had turned pretty dramatically on the hill, and the wet weather gear which I had removed in the earlier descent to Kingshouse was put back on. The weather had been forecast, but was probably at least an hour early.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Getting back on the railway I set about bringing my average time back down, and did manage to pull about 6 seconds per mile averaged back before my legs started to grind to a halt from around mile 24. There are probably a few factors involved, including perhaps running too strongly early, although I‚Äôm not so sure that played too much of a role. Bigger factors were probably the trashing of quads down into the forest and again off the top of the big hill combined with the windy, icy rain and inability to generate any warmth in the upper legs.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Although the segments from the later stages are barely better than previous years this run did not descend into a death march at any point, and there was no question or thought of dropping out. The road run out around Balquhidder was tougher than I remembered, although the weather and volume of standing water made things tough. There was also a lot more traffic on the road this year, and on more than one occasion I had to stop running as I approached two cars trying to pass each other.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I was happy to finally make it into the finish area where Vickie whipped me straight into my heated snowboarding jacket and into the truck to dry off and warm up. Somebody also tried to catch me up on the run into the finish, which made me run a little faster over the last 50 yards or so.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Overall if I‚Äôm being honest, then I would have to confess to being very disappointed with this run. I probably only lost around 10 minutes against those running around me on the second half of the run, but I had felt that I could do so much better. Perhaps in better weather, and with a less troubled run up I would have done. In any case that rounds of 2013, with 2014 commencing in around two weeks time after a little down time.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>All that remains to be said is a quick thanks to Bill and Mike for staging another classic race, and to everybody daft enough to stand around in the rain helping out and making the event possible.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:html -->\n<iframe height='405' width='590' frameborder='0' allowtransparency='true' scrolling='no' src='https://www.strava.com/activities/92995112/embed/e1b1b06d08b9e048bdb0d1759b9fc130b1aa7958'></iframe>\n<!-- /wp:html -->\n",

I came to regret this as I struggled with a recurring virus after the Speyside Way race which refused to clear. The weather forecast was pretty ominous, and I did seriously consider giving the race a miss. Ultimately I decided that I‚Äôd spent best part of 6 weeks training specifically for the race, and that I just needed to man up.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Again, with hindsight that was probably a mistake, but I simply did not want to throw another race away this year.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The weather was very changeable throughout. Wet and windy from the outset I started in jacket hat and gloves, but these had been stowed away in my sack by the time that I had dropped to Flotterstone. I felt that the move up and over Carnethy went as well as I could have hoped, and indeed I beat my training splits over this range. The weather deteriorated seriously as I headed out to South Black Hill, with visibility markedly reduced, and so the wet weather gear went back on, only to be removed again for the climb up Hare Hill shortly thereafter.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The descent from Hare Hill to Black Hill had moved to the East of what I had trained on. It was steeper, wetter and more precariously poised. I did not enjoy that particular section, and was happy to get running again on the climb up Black Hill.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Bells Hill is probably the hardest part of the route, not in itself, but because of the combination of its grade and position late in the run. I knew this was coming, and was prepared for it, making good time to the top. I underestimated how much climb was left though after Bells. I was pretty underfuelled by this point so ate, but bonked all the way up the final range before the food started to work. The coat came back on as the weather deteriorated greatly again on the summit, but I was able to run strongly into the finish at the ski centre at Hillend.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I had been aiming for around 4 hours for the circuit, but finished on 4:34. I was not to disappointed with this as with better fuelling I would have been much nearer to 4 hours anyway, and hillrunning is not one of my strengths anyway.

The first segment of the race along the riverside from Glasgow went pretty well, and I was glad that I had made a last minute switch into road shoes, with a 9 min/mi pace and a swift drop bag changeover at CP1. The terrain changes after the first checkpoint, leaving behind the tarmac and running through grassy fields with a narrow track and less certain footing. On another day this section would have been lovely, but I found the heat unbearable, and the pace began to drop off.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>My stop at CP2 took somewhat longer as I refilled my camelback and added extra water due to the heat, taking on with a full 2L, having run out shortly before that checkpoint.

Some shade appeared after this stretch though, and upto around mile 25 was ok before struggling into CP3 at around mile 28, where I added in another couple of litres.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Going through CP3 I had pretty much committed to finishing, and again between miles 28 and 31 there was some uplift in pace before approaching the road through a village where I acquired even more water at the shop around mile 35.

I knew from the D33 in 2012 that I had screwed up my water mix and was starting to suffer from a bit of sodium poisoning. At the checkpoint I swapped out my electrolyte for water, and took on some lucozade, losing a good 15 minutes in the process, and decided to see how the next leg went.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This was too little too late though, I felt worse through the next 5 miles, and decided that come what may I was going to withdraw at the checkpoint in Alyth. As the leg went on I did begin to feel better, I finally began to sweat and cool down, and to move better, and largely maintained position, and I finished strongly into mile 26 where I withdrew.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>While the hydration issue was the main factor, if I am being brutally honest it was not the only one. Others were:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list {\"ordered\":true} -->\n<ol><li>Improved but insufficient core mileage.</li><li>Insufficient hillwork</li><li>Little ‚Äúmudwork‚Äù</li><li>Poor fuelling</li><li>Blistering</li></ol>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There are positives I am taking from this race though:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list {\"ordered\":true} -->\n<ol><li>I now realise that my body core temperature relates directly to hydration and sodium levels.</li><li>My performance itself was not bad.</li><li>I finished strongly</li></ol>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Ultimately it was clear to me that I would not finish the race, and I wanted to preserve for the rest of the season. I do not feel too bad tonight after running just short of a hilly trail marathon earlier, and I am hoping to turn this weekend into a good back-back session. While I am worried about whether I can be strong enough for Ring o‚Äô Fire at the end of August I fully expect to go strong to the Clyde Stride next, and absolutely rock it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>On a more sentimental note a few tears have been shed, and as the title suggests I feel a little heartbroken right now. Perhaps my memory of the day will be being driven home listening to ‚ÄúParadise‚Äù by Coldplay, streaming. However the positives speak for themselves, lets embrace them, keep working away, enjoy being injury free, sort out the issues identified, and build, and get out tomorrow and run my legs off.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:html -->\n<iframe height=\"405\" width=\"590\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://www.strava.com/activities/54917435/embed/d36e406c8d42e20c28e1063b3d320fdb0a6ac6ac\"></iframe>\n<!-- /wp:html -->\n\n<!-- wp:gallery {\"ids\":[720,719,718,717,716]} -->\n<ul class=\"wp-block-gallery columns-3 is-cropped\"><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"https://leeperry.micro.blog/uploads/2023/7a6a282c6f.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"720\" data-link=\"https://lee-perry.co.uk/uncategorized/just-a-wee-bit-heartbroken__trashed/attachment/imgp0024-jpg/\" class=\"wp-image-720\"/></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"https://leeperry.micro.blog/uploads/2023/435fa3853f.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"719\" data-link=\"https://lee-perry.co.uk/uncategorized/just-a-wee-bit-heartbroken__trashed/attachment/imgp0023-jpg/\" class=\"wp-image-719\"/></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"https://leeperry.micro.blog/uploads/2023/953893c011.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"718\" data-link=\"https://lee-perry.co.uk/uncategorized/just-a-wee-bit-heartbroken__trashed/attachment/imgp0021-jpg/\" class=\"wp-image-718\"/></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"https://leeperry.micro.blog/uploads/2023/9d12ef7467.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"717\" data-link=\"https://lee-perry.co.uk/uncategorized/just-a-wee-bit-heartbroken__trashed/attachment/imgp0020-jpg/\" class=\"wp-image-717\"/></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"https://leeperry.micro.blog/uploads/2023/df85e6302f.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"716\" data-link=\"https://lee-perry.co.uk/uncategorized/just-a-wee-bit-heartbroken__trashed/attachment/imgp0016-jpg/\" class=\"wp-image-716\"/></figure></li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:gallery -->\n",

				"content_text": "<div>This week started badly as I had reopened a blister on the ball of my right foot from London during the long run last Sunday and the combination of an unfamiliar footing and broken ground up at Glen Tanar on Tuesday evening had left my right peroneus longus very sore, sufficient for me to miss training on Wednesday and Thursday. After a combination of foam rollering, massaging and kinesio tape I felt ready to run again on the Saturday. &nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>As I had an exam on Friday, which did not go well, the k9 children were in kennels. &nbsp;We had planned to take our now running mobile, Eleanor - a VW T2 Transporter panel van, out into Glenshee where I would have a tranquil morning run. &nbsp;This plan went out of the window when I overfilled the fuel tank filling Eleanor with a heavy smell of petrol. I had been scheduled to run twice for around a hour and a half each, but as the ankle still felt quite painful in the morning I opted to miss that session altogether in the end, but headed out in the evening for a bit of a test run in my old Asics Gel Nimbuses.</div><div><br /></div><div>The evening run on Saturday went bizarrely well, floating through Aboyne castle with ease I looked at my watch to discover that I was threatening 8 minute miles, so I opted to extend my normal circuit slightly to head out as far as the golf course, and to let my legs go as quickly as they wanted to while not forcing the pace. &nbsp;The pace slipped to about an 8:15 min/mi average on the climb back up from the Dee to the Deeside Road, which I was pretty happy with.</div><div><br /></div><div>Conversely on Sunday morning I was only supposed to run for about half an hour, but opted to put a few extra miles in the bank given the last week, just heading out to Dinnet and back on the Deeside Road taking in the views towards Mount Keen and Lochnagar on a perfect Aberdeenshire Sunday morning. &nbsp;Not sure where the grim weather is today, but it's sure not here! &nbsp;Again a little into the run I looked at my watch which was averaging out at 9:30 min/mi and dropping and pulled that down to 08:55 min/mi with the help of a few negative splits on the return which for once were not induced by k9 Steve McQueen. &nbsp;I had intended to run in my old Terrocs, which I have been thinking of switching into for the Cateran race, but changed my mind primarily because I could not find them! &nbsp;I did opt to compeed up the old London blister which is healing nicely now, and the heel which blistered up as I wore through the heel webbing in my Inov8 Mudclaws, and this seems to have worked.</div><div><br /></div><div>So in brief a week that threatened to be a disaster so close to the Cateran 55 race ended up being not so bad, and gave a few ideas for how to cope with certain aspects of the race.</div><div><br /></div><iframe allowtransparency=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"405\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"http://app.strava.com/activities/53741293/embed/87605314bdf380f88971550c9034ac487d61076e\" width=\"590\"></iframe><iframe allowtransparency=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"405\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"http://app.strava.com/activities/53741294/embed/bf3474bcc4c054c8b3ed946c5aaed4c7e2011734\" width=\"590\"></iframe><iframe allowtransparency=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"405\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"http://app.strava.com/activities/53026266/embed/a7a97c992591116372f32ed9bfb0087fde06cadc\" width=\"590\"></iframe>\n",

				"content_text": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I had known that I would be running the London Marathon since September, but an injury riddled 2012 combined with a low mileage asthma riddled winter, 3 weeks in Vietnam and a post travel bug meant that after the Glen Ogle 33 in November the sum total of my training for London was 3 weeks on treadmill in Vietnam, 2 weeks on trails back in Scotland, and then a week trying to remember what it felt like to run on tarmac, and in road shoes. This combination of factors along with the start of my ultra season just 4 weeks after London meant that I had to be realistic in what I hoped to achieve, and I settled on aiming for 4:30 rather than the hour quicker that I feel I am capable of if I can stay injury free.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The marathon weekend is all a bit manic, and London itself is a bit of a shock to the system living in rural Scotland. We had travelled down on the Friday evening too late to get from Gatwick to our hotel in Hounslow courtesy of runway repairs, and landing on the wrong runway, so stayed in the Premier Inn at Gatwick which was fine. The following morning we had to get up and straight across to Hounslow to drop our bags before heading on this great voyage across London on the underground, much of which was overground, and then on the bankers line out to the excel arena to register for the race. Cue a couple of hours later, several hundred pounds lighter courtesy of the Adidas store, offset by several pounds of pasta, we had everything that we needed and headed back across to Hounslow for a curry with friends.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Vickie escorted me as far as the train station at London Bridge on the Sunday morning from where I simply followed all of the people carrying red race bags. I didn‚Äôt have a drop bag, as I decided to run with my new Camelback ultra sack, which was awesome. I do hope that nobody followed my red bag, as that went straight to Surrey Quays with Vickie to where she was hoping to first see me. After a short free train ride I arrived at Blackheath common, and was surprised to find myself in a far faster pen than I had any chance of running, so positioned myself at the back of the pen.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Before the race commenced the mens elite field were announced, and there was a big cheer for Mo Farrah who was not actually going to run the race, and then a pristinely observed silence in memory of the victims of the Boston Marathon bombings just 6 days prior.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Then the race got underway. I was moving far too quickly at the outset, pulling out a good 20 minutes on 4:30 pace, before slowing this down at around the 10 mile stage. I missed Vickie at Surrey Quays as I was on the other side of the road and the field was still very dense at this point. The sky was blue and still, and as early as 8 or 9 miles in some competitors were starting to fall by the wayside. I had opted to wear the nestle pure water, rather than drink it, which kept me nice and cool, but did result, unusually for me, in pretty bad blistering. As I went through the two way section (miles 13 and 22 perhaps) I saw a cosmic hill-basher coming the other way, as well as a few Tipton Harriers who I had not realised previously wear green and white hooped vests. I did get quite emotional courtesy of a couple of pipers along the way, and enjoyed confusing the Welsh spectators by shouting at them incymraeg possessed courtesy of a mis-spent youth at the University of Swansea (Prifysgol Abertawe).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I was still sailing along quite nicely at about mile 19 when I did see Vickie stood outside the tube station at Canada Wharf, and it was not until about mile 20 that I started to suffer. The next 4 ‚Äì 5 miles were a run-walk affair, which was probably harder than just running given the blistering that I had, but the mile times were not horrendous and I just carried on plugging away. The palace of Westminster looks immense as you run up to it, and I was able to run for the last mile and a half or so. I was overtaken by somebody on the approach to the finish line which served as a bit of a cue for a sprint finish, after which I collected this little baby‚Ä¶ as well as my finishers T-shirt.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I was happy with 4:2500, it would have been much quicker had I not slowed the pace down after 10, and but for the blistering. That said it was pretty much bang on target, and for the first time I started to gain some confidence that the Cateran 55 is possible, and that I can do it, it may just take me longer than I would like!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I enjoyed the run, but I doubt that I‚Äôll run London again for a number of reasons. Mainly that there are just too many competitors on the course which results in a lot of aggressive overtaking elbow moves, slips and trips which simply do not happen in the ultras that I have run in. This is replaced later on with runners simply stopping and walking in the middle of the road towards the end forcing the person behind to do the same, and the meet and greet area was full of zombies of all ages stumbling across my path in random directions making it very difficult just to walk over to where Vickie was waiting for me under her hello kitty balloon. I was not a big fan of the noise and banter either, the coos and sheep don‚Äôt really say much when I run past them up here. I recall being told at about 24 miles, in my grumpy spell, by a spectator to run, and as those who know me will expect I responded with ‚Ä¶.you effing run then!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I must have enjoyed it though, despite my inherent grumpy nature, as I didn‚Äôt take my finishers shirt off for a week, and as of today (1st May) I‚Äôm still wearing my pace band around my wrist!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:html -->\n<iframe height='405' width='590' frameborder='0' allowtransparency='true' scrolling='no' src='https://www.strava.com/activities/50416616/embed/3b10623d6d40976057e576496146ab3a06f874cc'></iframe>\n<!-- /wp:html -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

I wasn‚Äôt feeling particularly fit and well which I am putting down to my training being too specific to ultras, but pushed on to hold a similar pace in the second mile, and slowing a little in the final mile to around 8 minute mile pace, averaging 7:45 miles and completing the race in 24:05, which I was very happy with, but also think is very beatable next week.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Having thoroughly enjoyed the race, and the pace of it, I reflected upon my recent ultra training, and in particular some of the lateral pain in the right knee. Despite having a very poor winter following a bout of bronchitis after the Glen Ogle 33, I managed to somehow put in sufficient miles to complete the D33 in March. However the Cateran Trail Race is looking a step too far at the moment. It has been in the balance for a wee while, but as the race gets closer it is becoming abundantly clear that I do not have the underpinning fitness that I need. For that reason I am going to defer my entry until next year to enable me to concentrate on developing speed and CV fitness to enable me to run more competitively at the Clyde Stride in July, and hopefully to be in less pain afterwards.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I have been putting a lot of work into rebuilding this site over the weekend. All of the posts and texts have been uploaded, and I have uploaded most of the photographs into picasa.

Caught out by an upside down sign, that wasn‚Äôt upside down we found ourselves back at the drop into the forest on which I had eaten my flapjack made by Vickie on the way in. We followed the same way back to our entry into the forest, before running up and down the hill that we should have exited on to make the mileage up. The upshot was that we did more hillwork than we needed to, and I paid the price for this as I tore something in my right thigh.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>On my way into the third checkpoint (which was at the same place as the second) I was met by Vickie, Steve and Liam, and told Vickie that I was struggling a little as I had just felt the pain in my thigh. Stopping at the checkpoint I refilled my camelback and picked up a calzone from my drop bag , which was absolutely awesome.

We had to run for the boat both leaving and returning to Keswick, but were lucky to make both sailings. The weather was largely good, and we had an awesome day, the rain holding out till we were back on the boat!\n",

With visibility drifting in and out, I knew that we were not too far away, and when it was suggested that we turned around here, it was my vote that decided that we should continue, and I chose to do so as I was now quite happily walking away in crampons, and really felt just that little too close to turn around.<br /><br />We summitted Braeriach at about 14:00, only knowing that we had done so when we began to descend quite steeply. Reversing we found the cairn, and carefully made our way down, myself more on instinct than the precision of Ian and Tim, but between us we found the route fairly well. Our footprints from ascent had been entirely obliterated by the spindrift.<br /><br />The spindrift cleared as we descended, but only intermittently, before finally clearing at about 900m. We kept the crampons on far too long, only taking them off when we next paused at the col above the crossing of the Lairig Ghru. The numerous falls on the way contributing to another sore knee!!!! I was concerned by the 20 minutes spent here as I desparately wanted to get through the Chalamain Gap before dark, knowing that there would now be snow in it.<br /><br />I set a good pace up the hill to the gap, and noted that I felt as fit as I had prior to my 3000s attempt in the summer for the first time since. We cleared the gap whilst it was still in good light, and indeed did not require the head torch to reach the car.<br /><br />On the Thursday I felt that my right knee was very sore and immediately abandoned my plans to walk every day. I went to Aviemore and then Inverness with Andy Brown, procuring Butterfield's 'High Mountains' a book called 'The Black Cloud' which details Scottish mountain accidents and is absolutely fantastic, in addition to a new pair of Marmot 'Borealis' gloves. I was delighted to discover that as I have tiny hands I required child size gloves at half the price of the adult's!!!!<br /><br />On the friday I also did not walk, and it turned out to be a fabulous day. I regretted this decision, as my knee felt ok after a brisk stroll up the road, but with retrospect it was the right decision. I'm hoping that a couple of weeks rest will allow it to heal sufficiently.<br />\n",

				"content_text": "<p>The fisrt day of our week in Fort William was accompanied by the finest weather of the week as demonstrated in the photographs below. It was also by far the coldest day, and although there were times when crampons probably should have been worn, this was only on the plateau.</p>\n<p>We emerged from our beds at the Colluna centre in Fort William, which must be fully recommended, with the objective of walking from Polldubh prior to 9am. This we managed, the sky still rather dull as the walk-in commenced. The climb through the gorge was rather impressive, only surpassed by the view on entering the plains above surrounded by the Mamores and Nevis ranges with the waterfall at Steall in the foreground.</p>\n<p>The track across the valley bottom came to a point near the ruins at Steall where a large wooden footbridge crossed the burn. We would cross back over this bridge later in the day, but at this point we turned left (north) to ascend alongside the stream, heading for the high bealach joinging the aonachs to Carn Mor Dearg. Again after climbing through a rather steep gorge, we emerged at the foot of a high level valley, with the bealach always visible in front of us. Eventually we climbed steeply up to the bealach where we paused for lunch.</p>\n<p>Obviously at this time of the year daylight hours are a major consideration, more so in Scotland, and I had been concerned on the drive up to notice that it was dark at approximately 4pm. It was with this in mind that we had set out so early, and set a relentless pace throughout, having to catch up after each photograph!</p>\n<p>From the bealach we set immediately upon the climb up on to the Aonach Ridge. The climb is very steep, and this occasion large areas were covered in ice. Due to the mixed nature of the terrain it was impractical to wear crampons, and thus we simply had to avoid the ice. A few problems overcome we emerged upon the ridge well ahead of the time within which we needed to do so. It was at this point that we knew the traverse was on.</p>\n<p>The walk from here to Aonach Mor is rather benign, and we enjoyed a gentle stroll up to it, whilst at the same time I was struggling to make the camera work. It was intensely cold on the summit, and thus we turned almost immediately in the direction of Aonach Beag.</p>\n<p>The climb up to Aonach Beag was slightly steeper, and it was probably here where crampons should have been worn, but even then the requirement was marginal. Again it was very cold on top (it being sub zero at ground level) and so we began to descend almost immediately.</p>\n<p>It was not very long before we were below the snow line, but agian the terrain was horrendously mixed, crossing a variety of frozen streams. I think that with retrospect I would be putting crampons on to cross these!!! As we crossed one frozen stream, at quite a low altitude (maybe 800m ish, I slipped and fell over. Lay prone on the ice I was unable to grab anything to impede the eventual slide downstream. Getting faster all the time I was trying to roll on the ice in the hope that I could roll off it. This proved to no avail, and I was starting to move quite quickly by this point. I could see quite clearly where the stream dived a rather long way over a cliff! Becoming despondent, a large mound of earth emerged behind me, and as I crossed this I made a concerted attempt to hold onto it, which slowed the slide, but I could not maintain my position. I started to slide past the mound of earth and the clif was far too close for comfort by now, I thought that this was it. In a last attempt to salvage something I rammed the front of my boots into the ice. Fortunately they broke through the surface of the ice, simply leaving the writer stood in a step.</p>\n<p>Mr. Eadon didn't take too kindly to the barrage of expletives that emerged from my mouth, enquiring as to what on earth was the matter. Where was I last time you saw me? \"Up there\" he responded, to which I replied and where am I now? \"Oh.....Stop playing in the stream silly boy\"!!!!!!!!</p>\n<p>Arriving back on solid ground, I took my time somewhat in descent, and was rather shaken though unhurt. I took to doing the longjump over the remaining froxzen streams in full winter gear, which probably explains why my thighs felt like they had been put through a sausage machine the next day.</p>\n<p>Not too long after this we came to a point where the descent is very steep (however there is a less steep way down involving a diversion deeper into the glen), and we split as a group. Geoff and I chose one gully, John and Chris t'other.</p>\n<p>On arriving at the bottom we could see no sign of John and Chris either on the slope, or in the valley below, and decided that they wouldn't have gone beyond this point without us, and must have turned back up the hill for a better descent route, as their gully looked horrendous.</p>\n<p>After half an hour, the couple we had watched descend in the belief that it was them arrived with us, and of course it was a completely different couple. With only 45 minutes of daylight left we had to get down at least into Glen Nevis before dark or risk finding ourselves benighted, as the descent would have been distinctly unpleasant in the dark.</p>\n<p>With the light fading all the time, our descent became faster and more furious. It was starting to darken when we reached the Glen, and I wanted to get through the gorge before it became fully dark. We raced through the gorge, the verglas forming on the rocks causing us to slide about on more than one occasion, but we arrived back at Polldubh before the use of torches became necessary. When we got back to the car, the boys we sat in it drinking warm raspberry juice. A traumatic day was not eased by a patch of ice on the bridge at Polldubh, on which we narrowly avoided a collision with the bridge. In turn this was superseded only by my cooking a meal the folowing evening, despite my protestation that we should eat in the pub and that I would pay....nice try?</p>\n\n<!-- wp:gallery

In any case I stood on each and every one of them just to make sure!</p>\n<p>I have taken an alternative approach to this page, and have opted to retain the best images at full quality, because the photographs justify the additional bandwith, so please accept my apologies in advance if you do not have broadband.</p>\n<p>The only major down side to the day was being forced to listen to a rendition of 'Bread of Heaven' in the Tai'r Bull. Guys, Seriously, I would not expect to be inflicted to a rendition of 'Land of Hope and Glory' on entering my local. In any event a chorus of 'Swing Low Sweet Chariot' soon emptied the lounge!!!!</p>\n\n<!-- wp:gallery

				"content_text": "<p>I met up with Paul today for the first time since we arrived back from Ullapool in the summer, and we opted to do a 14 mile circuit in the Berwyns. I have just had rather a shock updating this page though, as I thought that there was at least 1 marilyn on route, maybe 2, but in fact there are none. Must be getting old!!!!</p>\n<p>The circuit started and finished in the village of Cynwyd. We had a long road walk up to Moel Fferna, but the weather was quite pleasant at this point, turning as the day wore on. Part way up the track we took to a forest path which we followed to the Bwlch below Moel Fferna. When we arrived on the summit of Moel Fferna the wind picked up a little, and it became quite cold. Already wearing my insyulated jacket, I opted for gloves and balaclava at this point.</p>\n<p>Throughout the day the lie of the land deceived us, always believing that the top of the next bump was where we were aiming to go. As we ascended up to Cadair Bronwen, the wind picked up, and gave us a severe buffeting, it was difficult to walk, and even within a couple of metres of the summit I had considered turning back. I was gald to lie down on the summit and let the wind go flying over me.</p>\n<p>The weather continued to worsen until we returned to the Bwlch below Pen Bwlch Llandrillo top, and we followed the track from there back into Cynwyd.</p>\n<p>I had opted for my winter boots, which may have been a mistake as my knee was very sore on return to the car, although I have felt no repercussions since.</p>\n\n<!-- wp:gallery

I have taken it easy for the last two months where possible since injuring my knee, and have concentrated almost exclusively on climbing. With winter nearing I took the decision to jump into my winter boots, hoping that they would not cause the same hamstring problems as last winter, and they did not - touch wood!</p>\n<p>We walked up through Upper Booth from the car park at Edale, and ascended below Jacob's ladder. We proceeded along the plateau over Kinder Low to Kinder Down. We retraced steps to Jacob's ladder and proceeded to Pym's Chair, and back down into Edale along Crowden Brook.</p>\n<p>The weather was fairly considerate for the time of year, and it was a pretty good day all around, only late in the day did it produce a little precipitation, and that was minimal in quantity.</p>\n\n<!-- wp:gallery

We then followed the ridge along Walna Scar and up to Dow Crag. Desccending to Goats Hause we pushed on to the Old Man with beer and curry transposted by the two Smith Sherpas. We followed on to Brim Fell, Swirl How and Great Carrs. Returning to Swirl How we descended the Prison Band to ascend Wetherlam via Black Sails.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Apologies for the poor TR - hopefully the photos fill

I spent saturday with Steve, George and Chris on Little Tryfan climbing routes that were probably Mods or Diffs. We spent Sunday climbing Hope (VD) on Idwal Slabs. I rather enjoyed both days, although I had been particularly anxoious (even more so than usual) about my first multi-pitch. I found the climb to be quite comfortable, and will be climbing more over the coming weeks.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>On returning from climbing on Little Trfan on the Saturday evening, Chris and I made a quick dash for Yr Aran. We headed straight up the Watkin path, and turned on to the South Ridge track as it bears left from the Watkin Path. After maybe 100m on this path it bears off to the right at 90 ¬∞ at this point you carry straight on up the bank, and attain Yr Aran's South Ridge. We pushed up this along an easy to follow wall, until we came to a col with a path heading North towards Snowdon's South ridge. We made a note of this col and pushed up to the summit of Yr Aran. Having left Nant Gwynant at 19:00, we summited at 20:05 which is a little off pace, but we did have a couple of stops on the way.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We then returned to the col, and took the path heading north described above, as we did not wish to descend over the rubble we had ascended, as it was now getting dark. We arrived back on the Watkin Path before last light, and returned to the Hut without a need to resort to head torches.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:gallery

When I visited the GP on the Thursday morning, I don't think that she was aware to what she was opening the door when she informed that one could now participate in a little gentle exercise!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So it was a done deal, and I travelled up to Leeds to pick Dave up and drove on to Fort William on the Friday. The journey took approximately 11 hours (the return journey took only 7 and a half hours), and was plagued incessantly by the large white boxes that certain drivers insist on appending to the rear of their vehicles. Met up in the bar under Nevis Sport with Nobin and Dylan, had food and beer, and crashed out in preparation for the following days exertions.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We left the car park by the Ben Nevis Inn at 09:00, heading off into the cloud. I don't think that the route up the tourist track requires too much descriptive. The track being quite pronounced, I wouldn't expect navigation to present too many problems for most of the year. We climbed out of the cloud to an inversion, and enjoyed a thoroughly nice summer's afternoon climbing the Ben. This explains the proliferation of photographs below, as I don't expect that degree of view from the Ben to be occasioned too frequently. If there could be any grumbles about the day, then it would have to relate to the midges, who appear to like me somewhat.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Taking the route slowly to ensure completion, we attained the summit just outside of the guidebook time of 4 hours, which I felt was pretty good for a non-mountaineering team, I was quite impressed at the ease with which we all attained the top as I had expected it to be more problematic. So congratulations gents, really enjoyed the weekend.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I appear to have taken a little stick at the club in recent months with not completing the Welsh 3000s due to heatstroke, and now this knee injury. Those concerned should examine rather closely the rear to my rucksack - as they shall be seeing rather a lot of that in the coming months!!!!!!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:gallery

Rather than opt for a rather long North to South traverse, we decided to attack these two hills from the col sat between them. Having packed the tents up we probably left the campsite in Cwmdu at about 11:00.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We flew up Mynydd Troed, which is very steep in places from this direction, and has a number of false summits. Maybe the top 100m was encompassed in cloud, which was a shame as the view of Llangorse Lake was fantastic on the way up. Eventually we reached the trig point, upon which some riders had left their waterproof trousers.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Descending from Mynydd Troedd was more problematic due to the severity of the slope. Not liking slopes of this nature I took to the bracken and sped down as quickly as I could, arriving at the col a full 15 minutes before Bob and Andy. Whilst I was there a labrador type dog was staring at me. I did not think anything of this until I walked across the road and read a missing dog poster for an identical dog called Willow. I'll come back to this story a little later.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I was feeling a lot fitter than I had the previous day, and was moving much more quickly. I enjoyed the walk up Mynydd Llangorse, taking the Marilyn count to 3 for the weekend, and the cloud was not problematic by the time we were on top.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Andy suggested descending alonong an alternative path heading directly down to the valley, avoiding backtracking again. Bob and I concurred, and so we followed off down the hill. Before long we came across a farmer with a gun, and the owner of the missing dog. Not being totally sure that it was the same dog, we told him that I thought I had seen Willow at the Bwlch, heading down the road towards Cwmdu. We carried on down to the car, got changed and eventually set off home.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Driving back down this road we saw the dog again, and his owner was only 100m away. The dog had scarpered by this point, but we left the owner in the same field as him, hopefully they reunited at some point that day!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph

				"content_text": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This weekend was the follow up to the Wild Camping weekend last year on the same weekend at Styhead Tarn. On this occasion we opted to remain at the campsite in Cwmdu rather than camp on the Black Mountains as planned. It put the planned horseshoe route for Saturday out of the question, but made for a socially very enjoyable weekend. If anybody ever gets the chance to partake in the eating of dead cow in the Farmers Arms in Cwmdu, I would thoroughly recommend it! I have decided that next years meet will be at Ardgarten below the Arrochar Alps.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After an evening in the farmers Arms it was decided that we would remain at the campsite in Cwmdu for a sceond night. We were rather slow to get going in the morning and left at about 10am. I didn't feel on top form walking up the ridge to Pen Cerrig-calch. When we arrived on what we thought was the plateau, we were somewhat bemused by a large outcrop to our left, as Pen Allt-mawr has quite gradual slopes. John wandered off into the mist the wrong way whilst we examined the map. We realised that we were still on our way up the ridge, and hadn't actually reached the plateau - but John had gone. Eventually we decided to continue, and as we were begining to ascend again we saw a figure heading in the mist towards Cwmdu. We decided that it must be John, and 'we' decided that I should run after him and return him to the group. Taking a bearing on his lordship I set off, not thinking to leave my rucksack with t'other two. Before long I had caught up with Lord John, and we walked back to Andy and Bob on a bearing, finding them with no trouble.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Arriving on the plateau at the same time as another group we followed them to Pen Cerrig-calch before they disappeared in the direction of Crickhowell. We headed next to Pen Allt-mawr, sticking to the Eastern side of the plateau, and arriving with no further problems, meeting a group of lost youths in the shelter to whom we confirmed the location. By the time that we had arrvide on Pen Twyn Glas, the cloud was starting to lift, and this process was complete by the time that we arrived at Mynydd Llysiau.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Taking in views for the first time during the course of the day, we headed off up Waun Fach, on the top of which it rained on us somewhat. We retraced our steps to the bwlch below Mynydd Llysiau, and descended from there to civilisation and the nearest hostelry. We were provided with a lift back to Cwmdu from here rather fortunately by a local lady who happened to be visiting the pub!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph

				"content_text": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I suppose that after my failed 3000s attempt of the week previous I went into this route feeling that I had a point to prove. Nigel's 'don't go into the lakes looking for vengeance' had the same effect as a red flag to a bull!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>My plan was to ascend all the Nuttalls on the main Scafell ridge, which would be no mean feat starting from the New Dungeon Ghyll in Langdale. I knew that it would be a long hard slog, and had time allowed I would have returned over the Langdales to allow some variation - perhaps that was a little optimistic.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Arriving at the NDG at 11:00 the above listed team assembled and quickly set off on the road down to the Old Dungeon Ghyll, where we crossed Great Langdale Beck and made our way onto the Cumbria Way. Aware that we were up against the clock (we had to return to the coach for 18:30) we forced the pace along the Cumbria way, taking in a splendid view of Bow Fell and the Langdale Pikes. I found the climb up Rossett Gill far more difficult than I had anticipated, concluding that I was carrying a little lactic from the previous week. Fortunately I caught the frontrunners at Angle Tarn, and would not struggle again for pace during the course of the day.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We forged on up the path from here towards Esk Hause, the setting just got better and better. There was a cool breeze today, the lack of which I think played a major part in my failing on the 3000s. Turning at the stretcher box me, Bryan, Rob and Guy proceeded straight up Great End, and descended to the Esk Hause path as the backmarkers arrived.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We all then climbed about on the boulders of Broad Crag and Ill Crag, with the sole exception of Graham. Without anybody noticing he had proceeded straight up Scafell Pike. A mobile phone call from Grahm half way through our ascent settled the nerves, and we met him on the summit. It was now 14:00, as such anybody who says that Scafell Pike cannot be climbed on a coach meet is wrong. I estimate that had we returned from here to Langdale, we would have been back no later than 16:30.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A decision had to be made as to whether or not to proceed to Sca Fell. I knew that I wanted to go, and was confident I could do so and return for 18:30. In any case if we were late we would have a cold meal as opposed to missing the coach, which would be the normal consequence. My only concern was that I had no intention of going up Broad Stand, I haven't scrambled to grade 3, and didn't think that this was the right day to do so - with the pressure of time upon us.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I descended alone to the base of the Foxes Tarn Path, and climbed up through the gully, which I found to be a very pleasant climb although there wasn't a great deal of water running through it today. As I neared the top I heard Mike call me, and saw Rob behind him. They hadn't fancied the scramble and had opted to join me.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We ascended an horrendous scree slope past Foxes Tarn, and a dead lamb lay on the path side. How anybody can call this a tarn I do not know - I've seen as much liquid fly through a cafeter.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Arriving on Sca Fell we proceeded immediately to the summit, which is the first cairn on the top, and descended by the route which we had ascended. This route was far worse in descent - I wouldn't take it again by choice, and certainly not in the wet. We didn't proceed to Symonds Knot as we could not really see it in the clag, and it is not hugley clear on the OS map. Having checked at home, the col from which we descended is only about 100m from its cairn!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I wasn't hugely concerned at ommiting this top, I'm fairly confident that I will climb Sca Fell again at some point and we were a little pushed for time. Incidentally, Guy, Graham and Carol ascended via Broad Stand and would have had to ascend Symonds Knott prior to Sca Fell.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We regained the col where the others were waiting for us at 15:45 and set about returning on time. Guy set the pace and I followed him all the way back. Once we had ascended out of Angle Tarn we picked up the pace, lightly jogging down to the Cumbria way, and then along it. Guy and myself arrived at the NDG at 18:20 with Mike Nicholls arriving shortly after, and the others arriving at intervals upto about 19:15.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I feel a little better about the 3000s having put in a good show today, I'm already trying to put together the next team to attempt the traverse with, and I have sent off my registration for the Across Wales Walk. I think I'm having next weekend off before hitting the Black Mountains in a big way a week later - unless anybody fancies the 3000s?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph

Myself, Mike Smith, Mike Nicholls, Andy Brown, Guy and Chris were to attempt the 3000s with the support of Nigel, Nev, Andy Snape and Jan Cox. We met up with Andy Brown and Guy at a pub on the A5 on route to North Wales, but the delay caused by the traffic would delay our start somewhat. After eating at the pub we drove to the club hut, and prepared for the hike up Snowdon's South Ridge.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Leaving the club hut at about 22:40 we arrived at the cafe on Snowdon at 01:20 where we bivvied. Snapey forgot to bring his bivvy bag, so I was out in the open, but on a night like that it was far too hot anyway.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We awoke in the morning to a perfect sunrise, quickly prepared for the exertions of the day ahead, and Nigel and Nev carted our excess gear back to the hut. We raced over Crib y Ddysgl and Crib Goch, but it was 07:40 by the time we arrived in Nant Peris, so we were already running 40 minutes late at this point.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I felt absolutely fine on Elidir Fawr, and talked a dehydrated Chris into rehydrating and continuing. Everything changed so rapidly, I still felt ok on Y Garn, but had only 1 litre of water remaining to Ogwen, and rationed accordingly. The headache was begining to set in, and by the time I was on the summit of Glyder Fach I knew that I was in trouble. I enjoyed the bimble over Glyder Fach, but struggled to attain the summit of Tryfan. I was of the opinion that stopping to drink in Ogwen would sort me out, and that basically the day was in the bag.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Things didn't get better after Ogwen, Andy Brown dropped out there, and I continued with the others up Glan Dena. Quite quickly the nausea and dizzyness set in once more, and I knew at that point that I had to turn. I struggled on in phases for perhaps 100m more, but ultimately decided that I could not risk getting the top and not being able to continue or go down.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Ultimately I turned around, beaten only by the heat, and returned to Ogwen. The guys had already left, and I walked mistakenly West in to the valley rather than East to Capel Curig. Fortunately I was spotted by the guys in the car who had picked a couple of others up at Devils Kitchen. Having a full car, they continued the drop at the hut and returned to pick me up.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I would like to express my congratulations to the completers - Mike Smith, Mike Nicholls, Guy, and Chris. I'm paticularly pleased that Smithy completed, which is why I would not allow him to return from Pen yr Ole Wen with me. If the details above are vague or sweeping, then it is mainly because I am upset with myself for failing, for commiting such a fundamental error. It is the first time that I have not completed a route since<a href=\"https://exploringwildplaces.co.uk/blog/ogwen16012005/index.html\">Carnedd y Filiast</a>¬†in January, and I feel as bad about this as I did that, even though I'm on a different level now in terms of fitness than I was back then. One positive point to note is that Trydfan was Marilyn number 50!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I have to say in all honesty that in every other way I felt fine going up Pen yr Ole Wen, I wish that it was the case that I failed because of fitness or lack of training regime. However, this is not so. I failed because I was dehydrated and starting to show signs of heat stroke. The research that I have conducted since the weekend has illustrated what the deficiencies were, and I have a fairly good idea of how I will be preventing a recurrence. I am fairly confident that my current level of fitness would allow a 12 hour completion trig to trig, and I will be aiming for that next time.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>My message to the 3000s is quite simple - I'm coming to get you, and it may be sooner than you think.

				"content_text": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This flying weekend up to Scotland was the brainchild of Andy Brown, and I thought that it was an excellent opportunity to gauge myself for the Welsh 3ks whilst bagging some Munros at the same time. In addition to this I much prefer being in Scotland than South of the border, so it was not like I would ever turn the weekend down.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We were beaten up to the bunkhouse by Andy's car on the way up so proceeded immediately to the Ben Lawers Hotel to meet them, not arriving at the bunkhouse until about 01:30 on the Saturday morning. In consequence I was a little disorganised come Saturday morning, and it took over an hour to sort my gear out and get ready.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The plan had been in debate for the last week with regards to how to tackle the ridge. I didn't care whether it was taken from East or West so long as I got to tick all the tops, but the logistics were problematic. Ultimately all six of us bundled into the car, we dropped Ian, Hugh and Nigel off at the Visitor Centre, whilst Andy, Mike and I proceeded to the northern end of Lochan na Lairige.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The problem with tackling the ridge from the West was that you had to decide at the outset whether to go for the two more Northern Munros or not, and it was this that split the group. I was adamant that I wanted to do the seven, Mike and Andy were also willing to commit to the longer walk. Had we started at the East end we could have made the decision at the end of the day, and perhaps some of the others might have joined us, conversely we may have decided to give up!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We found a place to park at the end of the reservoir and climbed up away from it and into Glann Da-Eig from where we forged a path Northwards heading towards our first Munro of the day - Meall a' Choire Leith. The advantage of starting at this end of the ridge is that the bealach on which one parks lies at 550m, leaving the car at 09:40 we had summited this mountain by 11:00, and from this point of the day onwards we averaged a Munro an hour.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>On approaching Meall a' Choire Leith we contoured significantly around it to the ridge which adjoins it to Meall Corranaich. There is an obvious path from here to the summit and the steep South Western face of the mountain can be avoided.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We enjoyed fantastic views from the summit as illustrated in the pictures below. Andy joined Mike and I on the summit before we turned and proceeded to Meall Corranaich - one down six to go.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The walk along the ridge to Meall Corranaich is fairly pleasant, and steepens when one reaches the head of Coire Gorm and heads directly towards it. It was not long before we were on the summit and looking across to the clouds now dipping to cover the tip of Ben Lawers. By the time we had descended to the foot of Beinn Ghlas the cloud bas had dropped another 200m or so, and we would spend the majority of the remainder of the day encompassed within it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There is an obvious path below Beinn Ghlas which one supposed would lead to its ascent. In fact this path should not be taken as it leads up to Ben Lawers and would involve backtracking on a ridge walk of this nature. We headed directly up the North West ridge staying close to the crags falling to our left. Battling up through the heather was never really problematic, and before we knew it we were on the summit and in the cloud.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We were also now well and truly in tourist belt. Having not seen a soul for the first couple of hours, we would not experience solitude during the remainder of the day. The path is very obvious and easy going at all times. We were quickly upon Ben Lawers with a group, and descended to the bealach below An Stuck where we engaged in luch. I had felt quite light headed and tired at this point and wandered might I bale at some point prior to the end of the ridge, though I had no intention of doing so. However, I soon perked up after some food and drink and felt much better for the remainder of the day. Just as we were about to leave, Hugh appeared and went down to the Ben Lawers Hotel from here, having not liked the descent between An Stuc and Meall Garbh.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>At this point we were in the very base of the cloud, and we now ascended up to An Stuc, and back into the cloud. I was flying again now, but by the time I had seen the descent Hugh referred to I knew why he had turned back. The descent through a rubble filled valley is steep and insecure, and none of our party enjoyed it at all. However, it was over quite quickly once we had forged a way down, the right hand side of the gully being much more favourable than the remainder - 5 down 2 to go!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We ascended to Meall Garbh, talking for some time to a Scots couple for a while on the way up. At this point I thought that the walk was in the bag. The walk to the final top of the day is a fairly long one, but the ascent is gradual. Wanting to make a statement I ran up Meall Greigh, and as I arrived on the summit saw Ian and Nigel just below me begining the descent. They saw me immediately and turned around, and we waited for the remainder of the party to arrive. The walk out from here seems to take for ever - I believe it took possibly as much as two hours to get down to the bunkhouse in Fearnan.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When I had been sat below Ben Lawers, and particularly on it descent, I had been considering my chances of succesfully completing the Welsh 3Ks on Saturday 9th July. I decided that I might as well not turn up, but on descent from Meall Greigh I enjoyed a complete psychological turnabout - game on!!!!!!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I am now looking forward once more to having a crack at the Welsh 3Ks, I've been training for it since January. I was particularly pleased to tick 7 Munros in one day - doubling my tally from 7 to 14. There's only one way that I will double it on my next session, and that would be to do both Glen Shiel ridges in a day, which is just a little optimistic.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I fell asleep in the pub on the Saturday night, and they left me in the pub and hid in the car. This cute Aussie barmaid woke me up and told me they had left - the bunkhouse is about 5 bloody miles away. I took my vegeance by taking photographs of most of them lying on beds in various states of undress. If anybody would like me to publish those on this page, then please let me know. Any takers? No? Oh well!!!!!!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Weather:</strong>Mixed, Dry<br><strong>Accompanied by:</strong>Mike and Andy<br><strong>Distance:</strong>14

We arrived at PYP at approximately 10:30 after a swift dunny stop in Llangollen. On arrival we were somewhat lucky to get onto the car park, which was swarming with 3 Peakers.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Todays excursion was slightly exploratory, insofar as that I wanted my first encounter with Crib Goch not to be on my attempt to traverse the 3Ks on July 9th. Unfortunately I will still meet Tryfan for the first time, although I am assured that I am descending an insanely steep scree path rather than it's North Ridge.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I also wanted to test out my right hand which I had sprained about 10 days previous - injury sufficient to exclaim \"I'm incapacitated\" whenever any of my colleagues requested a cup of tea at work throughout the interim period!!!!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We set off from PYP up the Pyg Track, which I had ascended in¬†<a href=\"https://exploringwildplaces.co.uk/blog/snowdon14112004/index.html\">November</a>. We ascended rapidly to Bwlch y Moch where I had previously turned from Crib Goch and dawdled up the Pyg Track. I have to say though that the reasonance behind that was not so much that I didn't want to go up Crib Goch, but more to do with the amount of crap that I was carrying that day, and the new winter boots. Believe it or not I was 12 stone at that time, and eight months on I am exactly 10 stone, and flying in comparison!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>At Bwlch y Moch we turned right, bearing up towards Crib Goch. Arriving at the foot of the East Ridge we bore right to avoid being showered in scree, and scrambled up scree slopes onto the ridge further West.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I was aware that if my wrist played up on the first move, then I would have to turn again, and take to the Pyg. It was with some relief (and after copious amounts of Ibuprofen) that one incurred no pain on this move, or during the remainder of the scramble for that matter.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I seem to enjoy scrambling more each time I go, and particularly since my visit to¬†<a href=\"https://exploringwildplaces.co.uk/blog/20050429stanage/index.html\">Stanage</a>¬†in May.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The scrambling on Crib Goch is easy all the way, and I suppose the first 'difficult' move as such is the initial step up onto Crib y Ddysgl. I think the crux of the scramble is the exposure rather than technicality, and being in the cloud exposure simply didnt come into the equation today.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I particularly enjoyed the scramble, the holds are solid and obvious all the way. I could describe the traverse in just 3 words -¬†<em>better than sex</em>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Having arrived at Crib y Ddysgl we descended to Bwlch Glas, and then nipped up to the cafe for a cup of tea. I preferred Snowdon in November when the cafe and train were shut, and there were less people about, and the descent along the Pyg Track was little better than the summit with scores of 3 peakers and fell runners.

I was bemused somewhat by this suggestion, but seeing as though the club had failed to put the Aran ridge on the meet card, thought that we might as well have a pop at it</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The only thing that put me off this route was that I had completed a circuit a little earlier in the year around Foel Rhudd and Esgeiriau Gwynion. I knew that Paul and I had taken up pretty much most of the day on that route, which was less ambitious than what we completed today, and thought that I might not gain any new ascents as we could run out of time.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The four of us left the coach at Dinas Mawddwyat about 09:45 and promptly started biting into the 6 mile road walk up the Dovey Valley towards Bwlch y Groes. We had intended to head up to the Bwlch and over Llechwedd Du by the route that Paul and I had taken previously. Arriving at the foot of Llechwedd Du we decided to take the right of way on its flank, and to the ascend to the summit direct. This was far quicker than my previous visit, although the ascent from this side is quite fiercely steep - I wouldn't have wanted to be doing this at the end of the day. After a long pull up its flank, I soon saw the small white quartz cairn which I ran over to. We had taken the opportunity to have a bite to eat prior to the sharp ascent, sat over a hollow where a descending stream ran underground.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After a momentary pause on top the four of us headed off to Esgeiriau Gwynion. I thought that the group were going to do Foel Rhudd also, which we did not. I was not concerned by this, as I had ascended it on my previous visit, and it was also blighted by a tractor on this occasion.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Arriving at the top of Esgeiriau Gwynion I recognised the area where the cairn was located, and headed straight to it. By this point the weather had started to close in. The Aran ridge, which had been clear earlier, was now encompassed in an ever descending cloud, and rain was starting to fall upon us.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We descended to Bwlch Sirddyn a little to the left of the fence which I had previously followed. The ground underfoot here was much more boggy and difficult to cross, although the route up onto Foel Hafod-fynydd is less severe. John and I were the first to attain the ridge, with Chris just behind us, we met up later with Mike who had ascended along the aforementioned fence.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Before long we arrived at the first bump on the ridge, but John was none too impressed when I informed him that there were 6 false summits to come! We had lunch between the first bump and the summit, there is only one false summit in reality. The rain became more intense now, and I felt cold for the first time today. I had the waterproof overtrousers on at this point, and the gloves went on, and I remained wearing both until near the end of the day.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Ascending to the summit of Foel Hafod Fynydd we then descended direct to the foot of Erw y Ddafad-ddu which provides a nice staircase up onto the Aran Ridge.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>On my previous visit I had allowed myself to be fooled into not ascending onto the Aran Ridge, and had sunbathed under the crags. The ascent onto the ridge is approximately 300m, it is fairly steep, but I don't think it puts you as out of the way as the Nuttalls book suggests in the Foel Rhudd walk. Game on!!!!!!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Not really feeling fantastic on attaining the ridge, I had intended to walk down to Dinas Mawddwy as quickly as possible over Aran Fawddwy. My plan was soon thwarted when Chris announced that he was going to double the section to Aran Benllyn. The reasonance behind this is twofold. Firstly, I didn't really want Chris bimbling off with no support. Secondly, and rather more importantly, I didnt want to defer the ascendancy and allow anyone to bag another top over me!!!!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We had a good chat as we walked up to Aran Benllyn, and the stretches that I had felt in the left calf on the way up Erw y Ddafad-ddu were walked off on the ridge. We were well and truly clagged in at this point, but I think the route finding was fairly ok even in the cloud. Attaining Aran Benllyn we reversed back to Erw y Ddafad-ddu, and on up to Aran Fawddwy where Mike and John awaited us</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Homing in on the pub we headed down to Dinas Mawddwy, Mike guiding us very eloquently off the summit. I think that it would have taken a little longer had navigation been necessary. We headed over Drysgl to Pen yr Ally Uchaf, our last top of the day, before descending very steeply of its southern flank and into Cwm Cywarch.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The descent took longer than we had banked on. Chris and John had a quick pint in the pub whilst Mike and I waited outside, neither of us feeling like downing a pint. We arrived at the layby at 18:10, with five minutes to spare...how's that for getting the most out of a day?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Weather:</strong>Overcast,

We were dropped off at Nebo at about 10:45, and the weather at this point was quite cloudy, and I was quite prepared for a day spent battling through the cloud. We promptly set off up the country roads towards Llyn Cwm Dulyn.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I was on the coach with WBMC, and I knew that the 'led' walk were heading up Garnedd Goch, and completing the ridge from there. The first target of the day was to ascend Mynydd Graig Goch, and beat them to the top of Garnedd Goch!!!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Rather than descend back down to Llyn Cwm Dulyn we jumped the fence at Pant-y-gog, and followed it along to another fence, where we climbed out over a gate and on to the open hillside. From here the ascent of Mynydd Graig Goch is quite fierce, although the gradient remains predictably constant. In fact it is just easy enough to avoid the need to contour. Guy and myself lost a few minutes by climbing up the first outcrop that we came across, and when the others had joined us we proceeded around a large wall which we had to climb to get to the summit.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Rather promptly we set off down to Bwlch Cwmdulyn. I could see that the main group had not progressed far beyond the Bwlch and were following the nose along the wall. Neil, Guy and I battled through the heather and scree on the South face of Garnedd Goch, arriving only a few minutes later than the main party.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It was this section of the walk where things became confused, and which ultimately cost me the chance the ascend Mynydd Mawr at the end of the day. We paused here to have lunch, Andy, Guy and Darren leaving us at this point. When we left Garnedd Goch we quickly homed in on the led group, catching them on the summit of Craig Cwm Silyn. Having been in front of my group, I had not seen them walk beyond me, and only after walking about 300m back to the start of the summit area did it become apparent that they had passed.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>At this point I quickly ran back over Craig Cwm Silyn, and down the first 50m of the nose. During this period I overtook the majority of the led group, and I could make out Mike and Emily about half a mile in front. I reached a rockier section where I caught up with Neil, and there was a group of about six other people in front of us that we could not pass. As soon as we reached Bwlch Dros-bern I resumed my run, catching up with Mike and Emily about half way up Mynydd Tal-y-mignedd, to my surprise Neil had followed, and he was only about 100m behind.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Pressing onwards we soon came up to the obelisk on top of Mynydd Tal-y-mignedd, upon which Andy was climbing. I didn't fancy following suit, although there were plenty of foot and hand holds had I wanted to do so.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Having caught up with Andy, Darren and Guy we continued up to Trum y Ddysgl and Mynydd Drws-y-Coed. We scrambled down from there towrds Y Garn, and I felt that my scrambling had benefited greatly from my rock climbing weekend last weekend. At one point I was doing the splits in mid-air above Emily which could have made for an interesting photo.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Before long we were posing for a group summit photo on Y Garn, before what can only be described as a knee crunching descent to Rhyd Ddu.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>About 200m from the coach a torrential rainstorm started, although I was on the coach by the time it reached any great ferocity. Unfortunately, I felt that I needed at least two hours to ascend Mynydd Mawr and return to here, if not slightly more, so got changed. I was changed for 16:15, and proceeded to the pub, not liking their prices very much I returned to the coach to sleep. The remnants of the 'led' party returned at about 18:00 at which point everybody was dragged out of the pub and we set off home. Ironically, had I know that we would leave at 18:00 I would probably have run up Mynydd Mawr, although it may still have been a little too tight.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph

On the Saturday the weather was so poor that we wrote the day off and went to the pub, only for the sun to come out at about 3pm. I, Jonathan, Chris, Sophie and Nigel raced back to the bunkhouse to grab our gear, and after some initial wearines I completed my first climb - a V Diff.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I walked to the edge with Vanessa and John on the Sunday. I didn't really intend to climb, but nobody wanted to go Marilyn bagging with me, and I didn't have the list with me anyway. The rock was dry by early afternoon, and I started with a Diff, then another V Diff, and finished off with a struggle up a Severe.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>On the Saturday I walked to Burbidge with John, Jim and Vanessa,rounding off the weekend with a V Diff, and my first overhang - graded HS.

The intention was to park between Corndon Hill and Heath Mynd, and knock the two off, before proceeding to Long Mountain. We actually parked above the Hollies, and set off up Heath Mynd, which was by far the best Hill of the day, almost Berwynesque. We then returned to the car and drove over to Corndon Hill.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>For Corndon Hill we parked at the car park at the nature reserve by Hurdley. We had tried to drive up the track as far as Cowlton, but could not find adequate room to park. We walked back along this track through Cowlton and along the open hillside to Corndon Hill. We walked past the forest and ascended along the far side of the trees, visited the summit. We had a little wander around on the plateau before heading back down alongside the other side of the plantation.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Titterstone Clee Hill is actually worse than Brown Clee Hill, in fact it actually made Brown Clee look inviting. We probably only parked about 50m of ascent from the summit, which I would normally have a huge ethical problem with ticking. However, as this is the worst hill that I have ever had the misfortune to set foot on, I will not be going back to re-tick it - I would rather spend the weekend pulling my teeth out with rusty

I spent the few days beforehand preparing, sleeping and hydrating ready to do duel with the Yorkshire 3 Peaks.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Leaving West Bromwich at 07:00am, I estimated that we would be arriving at the Ribblehead viaduct at about 10:30. I was on the coach with the club, so the driving was out of my control and we had a finite amount of time to play with to complete the challenge. My pre-trip research suggested that Trail magazine had taken 10 hours to complete the challenge, although they did an extra 4 mile of road walking. I was quite concerned by this as it meant that they had taken 9 hours to complete the section of route that, traffic depending, I would have at most 7 hours to complete. Understandably I was becoming quite frustrated as the coach became momentarily lost in Ingleton following diversion signs that we did not need to follow!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We disembarked at the Ribblehead Viaduct at 10:40, so we had already lost 10 minutes, and at this point I did not honestly believe that the Three Peaks would get completed today. Steve had been telling me that if I wanted to complete the walk then I would have to keep pace with Mike all day - and that is a daunting challenge indeed!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As it was I spent most of the day setting the pace, which I was quite pleased about. Immediately turning from the junction where the road heads for Horton, we made a beeline for the viaduct itself, which we crossed under. Cutting an aggressive line up the flanks of Whernside, we were on its summit by 11:40. I was more than happy to have taken a half hour out of Mike's previous ascent, and it meant that we were on course for completion after the first obstacle. The path that we took up Whernside is very steep and very slippy, even with just the slightest moisture, and its only advantage is the speed of ascent. Those not interested in time should follow a more subtle ascent via Knoutberry Hill.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After we had all regrouped on the summit we headed off back down the ridge the way we had ascended. We continued past the turning for the steep ascent that we had followed, and eventually the path breaks to the left away from the ridge fence, and descends to Chapel-le-Dale. Again at this point we were stretching the pace out as much as possible, although I was pleased by how tightly the group remained together - even those with no intention of going on to Pen-y-ghent at the end of the day.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The period out of the cloud was relief from that in it, though at no point did we really get hammered by the weather today, and I think that the forecasts of 40mph winds on the summits were a little excessive. I revelled in the long walk across the flag stones to Ingleborough, but again we came to an area where the ascent becomes very steep, but a good path winds through the scree. Again, there are far steadier approaches than this onto Ingleborough, and this one would only be chosen for the speed of ascent.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I was quite please in ascent of Inglborough as the GPS was predicting an ETA of 16:30, which although I didn't quite believe, did confirm that we were right on track to complete the walk. The summit of Ingleborough too was in the cloud,but we paused in the shelter for maybe 20 minutes before heading back down the track we had ascended.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Heading along the spine of the ridge we soon dropped out of the cloud, and the path into Horton appeared at pretty much the same time as Andy Brown, who had taken the steadier ascent of Whernside. I immediately zoomed off along this path overtaking various family groups on the way, though I did have to wait a few times for the group to catch up as I did not particularly want to ascent Pen-y-ghent alone.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This section of the walk is quite steady, and I would imagine that it is a very nice route of ascent from Horton. Indeed this was probably the section of the day that I enjoyed most, strolling along chatting with Mike and Chris.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There was some debate as to if we should continue on to Pen-y-ghent. I had decided long beforehand that if I was in Horton before 15:30, then I would ascend. Ultimately myself, Oliver, the two Mikes, Guy and Chris would continue on. Jonathon also completed the walk alone. Spending perhaps 10 minutes in Horton taking outer layers off we then continued on to Pen-y-ghent. We had intended to leave some gear at the coach, but the driver was not around, we departed at 15:24 still carrying full gear in beautiful sunshine.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>For the large part the ascent of Pen-y-ghent is quite steady, ascending from the South of the ridge. With retrospect I think it would be easier at the end of a very long way to go up the Pennine Way, which is the way that we descended. I found the very last sections of ascent quite difficult, but the outcome was never really in doubt. We paused on top for a moment, arriving at 16:20, before heading down the Pennine Way to Horton. I was on the coach getting changed by 16:10, the others went in the pub with those who had earlier deserted us. The GPS timed the section of the day spent moving at 5 hours and 51 minutes, which I thought was quite impressive.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Unfortunately we had a wait of several hours back in Ingleton waiting for everybody to return to the coach, arriving home exhausted at about 22:00<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:gallery

We promptly headed off for Lake Bala via the Knockin route, and then up to Bwlch y Groes where we parked the car for the days walk. We probably started walking at about 09:30.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The route from the car park to Llechwedd Du is quite straightforward in terms of direction. You simply follow a fence that begins at the rear of the car park, and follow it onto Llechwedd Du. There is high ground to the left and the right of you when you reach the summit area, but the highest point is South of the fence where a small collection of white quartzite stones comprise a cairn. The terrain up to this point is quite boggy, and the negotiaion of it is not the quickest. This culminates in a very boggy area immediately below the summit of Llechwedd Du, though it eases from this point and is never really an issue for consideration during the remainder of the walk.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Leaving the summit of Llechwedd Du we followed the fence to the col between it and Esgeiriau Gwynion where we crossed the fence and skirted off in a more Northern direction towards Foel Rhudd. There is a stream that has to be crossed here, and in places the banks are very steep, but we soon chose an easy place to ford the brook and did so. We proceeded up the flanks of Foel Rhudd, where the summit is marked by a small white quartzite cairn, and a stake protrudes from the ground. We proceeded down in to the col prior to Esgeiriau Gwynion, where we paused for a bite to eat and a hot drink. The Aran ridge by now had shredded the cloud of mist that had earlier encompassed it, and we were certainly considering the ascent of all or part of it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We followed the fence up on to Esgeiriau Gwynion, when the view of the Arans cleared still further. I was pretty certain that we would be going up on to the Arans at this point, and made a hurried descent alongside a fence in a South Western direction. We forged our way across Bwlch Sirddyn, taking in the view of the incredibly steep NE face of Foel Hafod-fynydd that we were to ascend.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The ascent of this hill was fiercely steep, indeed we paused for breath several times on its ascent. Before long though we were on the summit taking in the views to the Arans. We were sat here from 13:00 till about 14:30, having agreed with Paul that any extension on to the ridge would push us out too far from the car. With retrospect this was a good decision, although we would later need the time that we had spent sat here.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We descended from Foel Hafod-fynydd ay about 14:30, heading Noth East along its' flanks, and taking care to avoid the gorge that steepens the further East one expedes. We reascended the other side of the brook obtaining a good track, possibly some form of historic mining track which we followed downstream to the waterfalls. At this point the map indicated that the right of way switched to the other side of the River Dovey, but when we reached the valley bottom we were unable to cross the river as the footbridge had magically disappeared. Having now checked my copy of this map, there is a path on this side of the river, and the footbridges are still marked. In fact neither exist. The right of way is the track that we had picked up at Bwlch Sirddyn, and anyone following this route should pursue that track out of the valley to emerge at SH905213.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Fortunately the farmer at Ty-Canol allowed us to cross his yard on to a good track leading down into Pennant, after some congratulatory comments from Paul about the Welsh Grand Slam. I was smugly bearing in mind that it will be quite some time before he sees another one!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Having descended far too far we had put perhaps as much as 2 miles on our journey, with the diversion to Pont y Pennant and the search for the footbridges combining. It was nearly 17:30 by the time we reached the turning for Lake Vyrnwy, where we had a dilemna - go home and leave the outlying Moel y Cerrig Duon for another day, or to knock the bugger off.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It was an easy decision to make to pursue this last Nuttall, neither of us wishing to return to this valley in the near future, so up we went, reascending to the height at which the car was parked for the first time since about 15:00, and then beyond. We ticked the last top, which strangely resembled Carn Sgulain, an outlier that I had to leave behind in the Monadhliath. With a bit of luck the SMC will demote it and I won't have to go back, with it being such an undistinguished bump. Apparently there is a seismology station on this top, but I couldn't say that I noticed. Although, being quite tired by now, I was not paying an excessive amount of attention.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We headed off back along the fence we had followed in ascent, and Paul walked past the fence that descends to Bwlch y Groes, before I called him to return. By 19:00 we were back at the car, and on our way, getting off the country roads before the onset of dark.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:gallery

				"content_text": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Having felt that I had been a little lazy on Sunday in the Peak District I was determined to make amends today, and an awesome day it was. I picked Paul up in West Bromwich at 07:30 which was a relative sleep in after the morning going up to Glossup previously. We headed straight for Church Stretton and found somewhere to park, which was in a bay directly below the Gaer Stone.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We walked back about 50m towards Church Stretton before proceeding up a lane past Gaerstones Farm and taking to the hillside near Helmeth Hill. It was quite misty at this point, and it was not clear what the weather would be like, though we were fairly sure that it could not possibly be as dire tas the day previous.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We descended down to a col prior to Caer Caradoc, along a slippery muddy track. I don't think that Paul was too impressed when I suggested that our predicament was somewhat similiar to that of West Bromwich Albion. The track up Caer Caradoc was much better and far less eroded, though it was very steep. We were soon on the ridge looking at some crags below Three Fingers Rock, and then sauntered along to the top of the hill, which is an ancient hill fort. Looking across from the summit The Long Mynd was still truly encased in mist, and the surrounding hills were fairing little better.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The situation improved rapidly whilst sat on top of Caer Caradoc, and only after half an hour did we meet our first compatriots of the day. After a period of time we headed of in an Easterly direction, meeting several groups on their way up.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We pushed on across the sheep filled fields around Cwm Farm, and then followed a track up the North East side of Willstone Hill. It soon became apparent that this track would not visit the summit, and we made a beeline directly for the Battle Stones on top where we had a little scramble on the rocks.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We left the summit, and proceeded in the bright sunshine to tick the tops of Hope Bowdler Hill, and spent some time scrambling on the Gaer Stone.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Descending to the road, we set off in the car to Callow Hill, Paul a little disgruntled that I made him take his boots off, but he got his own back by making me drive through a whopping great river. There is good parking just after the ford past Strefford below Wenlock Edge, and also directly below Callow Hill between it and Wenlock Edge. We set off up Wenlock Edge through what is the strangest path I have ever walked on. It was pure clay, and the slide marks from tourists in trainers went on for yards. I'm glad that I didn't have to wash any of their clothes afterwards. Come to think of it, I don't even have to wash my own....Cheers Mum!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Once we had attained Wenlock Edge we followed it North Easterly for a short while, perhaps a hundred metres or so, before turning downhill towards Callow Hill.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Only on Callow Hill did we really encounter crowds today, passing a couple of families on the route up another quagmire of a path through the forest. The summit itself is a bit of a building site at the moment, with the tower being restored. The trig point, bizarrely, does not lie on the highest point of the hill, but 2m below, and is the other side of a ghastly barbed wire fence. On the summit we were confronted by people, dogs, 4x4s and Quads. I personally couldn't wait to get down in to the forest.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It was a little more difficult to descend out of the forest than anticipated, but we were soon fighting our way through the fields where we found a dead badger. We followed a country road back to the car where we found a group fishing in the stream spreading litter everywhere. They had disappeared by the time I took my boots off though.<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:gallery

Some idiot had the idea of turning the clocks back last night, which I was oblivious to when I agreed to leave at 0630. So in effect that was me out of bed at 0430.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Paul picked me up at M6J10 and we headed off to Glossup via Congleton. The idea was to park on a hairpin bend just outside Glossup on the road running out to the East. We drove past this bend without noticing and didn't get to pursue the planned route. Even at this point we were immersed deeply in cloud.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We stopped at a layby which we discovered to be that at Nether North Grains, and decided to head up the Doctors' Gate path on to the Pennine Way.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We planned to take in Bleaklow, and Higher Shelf Stones which is a Nuttall that Paul hadn't completed. If it was clear and we could see across on ascent, then we would probably take Higher Shelf Stones first.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I think that it is quite fair to say that I had a relatively blond day today, displaying both my lack of experience of walking in the Peak District and a distinct lack of sleep. I spent the day referring to the Pennine Way as the Cumbria Way, and to Higher Shelf Stones, for some reason, as Clough Head! Fortunately I did not walk around all day with 99 red ballons in my head like t'other week at Langdale!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We had a brief view of Higher Shelf Stones from the Pennine Way, but we were too low to cross to it, and by the time we were high enough all visibility had gone. We proceeded straight up the Pennine Way and up on to the summit of Bleaklow.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After some deliberation, due to the visibility, as to if we should proceed, I set the compass to a SSW bearing, and off in to the wilderness we plodded.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Much to my amazement, and even more so to Paul's, we hit the embankment where it drops steeply exactly as intended, bumping into some guys from Bedford before pausing for lunch at Lower Shelf Stones.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We then duly proceeded on to Higher Shelf Stones. It was a bit of a jaunt to rejoin the Pennine Way, I think I was guilty of over compensating to the North to avoid any steep drops to the South, but eventually we found the path, and proceeded back down it to the car park. Here we bumped again into the group from Bedford, before going back to the car.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The visibility was as poor at road level as it had been on Bleaklow, and it was this that put me off reascending up on to Kinder, so we had a browse around the Buxton Book Fair instead.....going out to bag something else tomorrow - I have the suncream packed!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:gallery {\"ids\":[2436,2437,2438,2439,2440,2441,2442,2443,2444,2445,2446,2447,2448],\"columns\":5} -->\n<ul class=\"wp-block-gallery columns-5 is-cropped\"><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"https://leeperry.micro.blog/uploads/2023/e34852f93d.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"2436\" data-link=\"https://lee-perry.co.uk/exploring/mountain-walks/bleaklow-and-higher-shelf-stones/attachment/dscn0725/\" class=\"wp-image-2436\"/></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"https://leeperry.micro.blog/uploads/2023/b4acaf203d.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"2437\" data-link=\"https://lee-perry.co.uk/exploring/mountain-walks/bleaklow-and-higher-shelf-stones/attachment/dscn0726/\" class=\"wp-image-2437\"/></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"https://leeperry.micro.blog/uploads/2023/c68e93af9d.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"2438\" data-link=\"https://lee-perry.co.uk/exploring/mountain-walks/bleaklow-and-higher-shelf-stones/attachment/dscn0727/\" class=\"wp-image-2438\"/></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"https://leeperry.micro.blog/uploads/2023/a8e755432b.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"2439\" data-link=\"https://lee-perry.co.uk/exploring/mountain-walks/bleaklow-and-higher-shelf-stones/attachment/dscn0728/\" class=\"wp-image-2439\"/></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"https://leeperry.micro.blog/uploads/2023/fa39e25236.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"2440\" data-link=\"https://lee-perry.co.uk/exploring/mountain-walks/bleaklow-and-higher-shelf-stones/attachment/dscn0729/\" class=\"wp-image-2440\"/></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"https://leeperry.micro.blog/uploads/2023/f8750b34eb.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"2441\" data-link=\"https://lee-perry.co.uk/exploring/mountain-walks/bleaklow-and-higher-shelf-stones/attachment/dscn0730/\" class=\"wp-image-2441\"/></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"https://leeperry.micro.blog/uploads/2023/3acae3eff2.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"2442\" data-link=\"https://lee-perry.co.uk/exploring/mountain-walks/bleaklow-and-higher-shelf-stones/attachment/dscn0731/\" class=\"wp-image-2442\"/></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"https://leeperry.micro.blog/uploads/2023/6566e35cf4.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"2443\" data-link=\"https://lee-perry.co.uk/exploring/mountain-walks/bleaklow-and-higher-shelf-stones/attachment/dscn0732/\" class=\"wp-image-2443\"/></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"https://leeperry.micro.blog/uploads/2023/d0424f90f6.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"2444\" data-link=\"https://lee-perry.co.uk/exploring/mountain-walks/bleaklow-and-higher-shelf-stones/attachment/dscn0733/\" class=\"wp-image-2444\"/></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"https://leeperry.micro.blog/uploads/2023/d0419018cf.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"2445\" data-link=\"https://lee-perry.co.uk/exploring/mountain-walks/bleaklow-and-higher-shelf-stones/attachment/dscn0734/\" class=\"wp-image-2445\"/></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"https://leeperry.micro.blog/uploads/2023/99cccc8e04.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"2446\" data-link=\"https://lee-perry.co.uk/exploring/mountain-walks/bleaklow-and-higher-shelf-stones/attachment/dscn0735/\" class=\"wp-image-2446\"/></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"https://leeperry.micro.blog/uploads/2023/d8b91cb02d.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"2447\" data-link=\"https://lee-perry.co.uk/exploring/mountain-walks/bleaklow-and-higher-shelf-stones/attachment/dscn0736/\" class=\"wp-image-2447\"/></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"https://leeperry.micro.blog/uploads/2023/9b30c73b2c.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"2448\" data-link=\"https://lee-perry.co.uk/exploring/mountain-walks/bleaklow-and-higher-shelf-stones/attachment/dscn0737/\" class=\"wp-image-2448\"/></figure></li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:gallery -->\n",

				"content_text": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Had been hoping to do something today, but until Saturday afternoon it appeared most likely that I would be spending Sunday learning PHP as nobody wanted to go out today despite an absolutely fantastic weather forecast. Naturally I was quite pleased when Paul called Saturday lunchtime. The forecast was for 18¬∞C, no cloud base, and a wind of about 15mph. I thought I was going to have a nice ridge walk in the sun - I even packed the factor 20!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We had opted for a circuit on Black Mountain, believing it to be relatively near, in fact it is probably as distant as Snowdonia from Birmingham, it certainly took longer to get there and back.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I was quite surprised to awake to the patter of rainfall, and more surprised still to arrive at a mist filled Capel-y-ffin. I was quite confident that this was just a morning mist though, and happy that the sun would be out by late morning as promised.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We headed up to the church where we found a few people pottering around in the graveyard, and followed the lane past Nant Vision Farm where the right of way has been diverted around the farm. At this point we headed up a track through the fields, following the waymarks along Nant Vision until we arrived on the Black Mountain ridge just South East of the South Top.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We were unable to find the cairn on the South Top, and decided that it was either covered in heather, or had been removed from the hill. The mist was very thick at this point, but for a moment the cloud had cleared, and we had not been able to see this cairn anywhere. I'm certainly not going back just to tick that!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We wandered along for what seemed like forever on the Offah's Dyke path over Black Mountain proper in a northerly direction. If on the South Top we had been unable to find a cairn, we had quite the opposite dilemna on the main bulk which has been blighted by a proliferation of cairns, the ticking of all of which would be quite tedious!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The Black Mountain ridge seemed to last for an eternity. Whilst we were confident that we had not missed our turning for Hay Bluff there was an element of doubt. We sat and paused for a while, and as we did so a large hole in the cloud blew across, and the path heading to Hay Bluff became apparent approximately 100m to our North, and this had been completely invisible in the mist. Hay Bluff appears quite imposing from this direction, and I found it difficult to believe that it doesn't qualify as a Nuttall. Perusal of the map reveals it to have negligible rise on this face at all</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We proceeded over Hay Bluff taking in the first decent summit of the walk, and proceeded down to Gospel Pass on the track that I had driven in on. Hitting the road we turned left and almost immediately right and up on to the flanks of Lord Herefords Knob. This next segement of the walk was much more heavily eroded, part of the reason for which would become apparent later on. I was quite enjoying myself by this point, and soon found myself on the summit, and then heading off an a long dog leg to Rhos Dirion. At this point on the ridge 4 motorcyclists flew past us several times riding back and forth along it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This sector of the walk felt much longer than those which had preceeded it, yet the terrain was easy, and the only concern was that perhaps we had passed it. After a period of time had passed a white trig point emerged on the horizon, and all doubt passed, at this point I knew that the planned route would be in the bag. We spent about half an hour sat off the escarpment staring down in to an empty valley eating lunch.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We then began the final sectore of the day, heading back South East towards the car. We proceeded over Twyn Talycefn, which felt prominent enough to be a Nuttall, and I was surprised that it was not. For example, it certainly felt like it had more drop on all sides than Black Mountain South top. We passed a group of about 5 people in the vicinity of the Blacksmith's Anvill cairn on Y Fan. These were pretty much the first people we had seen sice departing from Rhos Dirion. We then found a couple of cyclists on top of Chwarel Y Fan. Back in the cloud/mist at this point we turned almost immediately heading back to Y Fan, from where a good track leads down to Capel-y-ffin. The Nuttall's book talks about this path weaving between cliffs, which I found to stretch the imagination a little.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The view picked up again as soon as we began to descend. I think that whilst the weather did not produce the expected results, I had a thoroughly enjoyable day, and felt pretty good afterwards for the 14 miles.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:gallery

Not having crampons I was a lttle concerned by the possibility of there being some ice up high so opted to go for High Raise insted, lured by the opportunity to bag the tops that I had missed in February.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We had a decent enough day, and the weather was excellent for most of it. We started at the southern tip of Thirlmere and headed off along Wyth Burn for the for the col between High Raise and Ullscarf. Having set off at 11:15 for some reason we didn't attain the col until 14:00. We headed on up, becoming disoriented at Low White Stones as we belived that to be the summit.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>What did make the day a little disheartening was looking over to the Dodds and Helvelly knowing that the walk I had planned would have been on.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Realising our folly we headed off over to High Raise, and then turned for Sergeant Man. Heading directly for Sergeant Man we mistook it for Pavey Ark,and ended up just below Codale Head.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Once we were on top of Codale Head it was possible to see into Stickle Tarn and Easy Gully, and it was possible to position ourselves. Unfortunately an excessive amount of time had been wasted and we had to head straight down Easedale along Sourmilk Gill. After a little sprint in full winter gear, I arrived back at the coach at 17:15 - bang on time Miguel.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:gallery

Andy hadn't done Hebog before, so we decided to do that, apparently it had beaten him a couple of times, and it had turned him back for one reason or another. Sounds a bit like my experience with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://exploringwildplaces.co.uk/blog/20050218newtonmore/index.html\">A' Chailleach</a>&nbsp;in Scotland a couple of weeks back!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I'm not going to rabbit on about the route too much, as it was an exact duplicate of that I pursued in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://exploringwildplaces.co.uk/blog/plasgwynant03072004/index.html\">summer</a>&nbsp;on the club's Plas Gwynant weekend.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>With reports of nothing but sludge on the tops we committed the cardinal sin of leaving axes and crampons in the car, there were times later on where we certainly could have done with the reassurance of an axe in hand!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The weather started off ok, but the cloud closed in as we were ascending through the crags on Hebog, it was chasing us as we were creeping up icy steps near the summit. Some guy flew past us wearing little more than a pair of trainers and a buffalo top, track suit bottoms, and no sack.....rather him than me! As we departed from the summit of Hebog we left the cloud, and the weather was fine for the rest of the day.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There was still a little cloud about as we passed over Moel yr Ogof and Moel Lefn, but nothing to write home about, and the sky pretty much cleared as we descended Moel Lefn. The path down from Moel Lefn was steeper than I recalled, and very slippy in powder snow conditions. I started to slide a couple of times, but fortunately managed to keep control - but I'm not too sure exactly how.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As we arrived down at the forest, we picked a route on the map, following without trouble down on to the old railway that is being restored. It was at this point where the sky completely cleared, this being the first time that I have seen the top of Snowdon out of the cloud. It is also worth mentioning that much of Beddgelert had been felled since my last visit, and the route finding outwards was far easier than it had been then.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!--

I had already been turned back twice for one reason or another by A' Chailleach, and it felt quite personal by this point.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Fortunately there was a group of nine other people who came on this walk. I expected a battle, and although the hill put up a fight it was too little too late.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We hit A' Chailleach by the route we had descended from Coire Dubh on Tuesday. Making a beeline directly for the Stalker's hut, straight up the slopes in to Coire Dubh.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Although I found this hard work on very tired legs after the previous week, I just knew that I would win today. Before long we were at the bottom of a snow field with about 100m of ascent straight up to the 930m summit. It was nice and clear, the sky was blue and the wind still. I looked up to the top and said 'I'm coming for you'.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Racing up the snow field, it did not take me long to get up on to the top and find the cairn. By the time the second half of the party had arrived on top some ten minutes later we were in a massive whiteout with winds in the region of 60mph driving a blizzard in. This was an absolutely unbelievably fast turn in the weather from one extreme to the other, as the photographs depict. This turn in the weather put paid to any secret ambitions that I had to tackle Carn Sgulain that day, but the important one was in the bag.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The descent was pretty unreal. We descended off the North West slopes of A' Chailleach and contoured back around it. I had been pleased by the terrain on ascent, much of the snow from Tuesday night having melted away. Coming back down much of this had been replenished, and again I found myself falling waist deep into hollows in the ground. It was good fun today though, whereas on tuesday it had been a bit like rubbing salt in the wounds. We were back at the hotel for about 14:30, and able to pack up before tea.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The return journey took about 8 hours with stops at Hamilton, Tebay and Sandbach. It was with a very heavy heart that I left Newtonmore on Saturday morning. Although we had only been there a week it felt so much longer, and walking into work on Monday felt pretty surreal.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In terms of pre trip ambitions I didn't get near what I had set out to do. With retrospect I am very happy with what I got in to the week. I am quite surprised that the walk I enjoyed most was probably up Creag Liath, which was absolutely fantastic. So until next year.....</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:gallery

				"content_text": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If today I had intended to go for A'Chailleach it was a non starter, as I could not seem to get a team together. I ended up, a little reluctantly, agreeing with Andy and Jan to go to climb the Corbett of Meall a' Bhuachaille, which is due North of Cairn Gorm. It was the cause of some excitement the next morning when Andy and Jan informed me that they were going to climb Cairn Gorm.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We set off as early as we could after breakfast to ensure we could get in to the top car park at the ski centre. We intended to leave at 08:30, but it was about 08:50 by the time we were able to leave. Myself, Andy, Jan and Sarah took off intending to walk up Cairn Gorm along Facaill a Choire Chais, and proceeding West over 1176m Stob Coire an t-Sneachda and 1215m Cairn Lochan before descending in a circuit back to the ski centre.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The route worked out pretty sweet, and apart from momentary glances at the GPS to find our way down from Cairn Lochan we were fine.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Setting off from the car park Jan and I in our rigid boots found straight away that we needed crampons to get up the snow on the heavily compacted paths, whilst Andy and Sarah were flying up in their more flexible boots. We struggled on for some time before eventually giving up the game and putting the crampons on. We knew that when we got to the ridge we would have to take them off again, which we did. The advice from those who had climbed Cairn Gorm the previous day was that crampons would not be necessary, and that the snow was very soft.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As soon as we began to ascend the ridge it became apparent that the surface was frozen, and we were slipping around considerably, I know of several people who had to turn here because they had not taken crampons. The crampons went straight back on, and were on until we dropped on to soft ground again in the evening.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We stopped at the cairn at the top of the Facaill were a couple of birds flew in to us. We were in the cloud by now, but it was quite a nice place to rest before finishing off the route. Pushing on up the ridge it took little time or effort before we arrived at the 1244m top, in fact this walk was probably the easiest of the week. Myself and Andy debated whether to attain the Munro one must ascend the radio mast, but quickly discarded the idea. I was delighted to have taken my first 4000er.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The only moment of concern was when Facaill Coire an t-Sneachda emerged from the clouds, which we initially thought was our descent route. Crib Goch looks a bimble in the park compared to that. We wandered past the climbers topping out of the Coire looking for friends, but finding none, and wandering back down towards the ski centre skirting the cliffs of Coire an Lochain.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I think it is quite easy to guess what I was going for on the Friday, alone or not. Had I not summited A' Chailleach on Friday, I would not have come home on Saturday!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:gallery

I think that I was concerned that my toils of the previous day might tell, and that an easier day was in order. If that was what I considered today to be then I was wrong.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Creag Dubh is a beautiful hill both from Newtonmore, and from Glen Banchor. I walked with Steve, John and Sarah. The object was to fly up to the top and race around to find Cluny's Cave.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We headed up the old road for maybe half a mile before heading up a farm track and over fields to a gate. The gate was locked, and the surrounding fence electrified. We had to climb over what looked like a huge stile. Whether we were supposed to climb it or not, I don't know, but it landed us at the foot of the ridge.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We headed up the ridge, and it took what seemed like an eternity in the cloud before we finally arrived on the 756m summit. Steve and I were particularly concerned about the crags on the map, I didn't fancy the look of them on paper and he had seen them before. We sat for lunch above some crags before skirting alongside the ridge in a South Easterly direction until the crags disappeared and the gradient became less steep. Resisting the others' urges to find a route through the crags to this bloody cave!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We proceeded over to the monument, looking back at the very impressive crags, trying to sight the cave. We were unable to spot the cave though, and we headed back down to the road through the valley between the crags and the monument.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Looking all the way down for the cave we were unable to locate it, and we then had to weather a very long road walk back to the hotel, I believe that we arrived back at about 16:00, so again it was 7 hours of walking.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The plan for the next day I think was quite easy - A'Chailleach and Carn Sgulain!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:gallery

The plan was to head over the tracks laid yesterday turning right at the bealach in Glenn Fionndrigh, and heading over to Carn Dearg. From here we were to follow the ridge over Carn Ban, Carn Ballach, and topping out the day on my nemesis, A' Chailleach.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We fired straight up the tracks we had laid the day previous to the col. I was breaking trail, and we arrived at the col by 10:30. We had been able to drive up to the car park, and the going was a little easier with the tracks laid the day previous. We headed right at the bealach, over a couple of bumps and streams, until we arrived at the foot of Carn Dearg.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>By the time we arrived here the sky was bright blue, and there was no wind, which meant that the day without question lived up to the forecast that it would be the best of the week. The group took a selection of routes onto Carn Dearg. Mike and Sara headed up the ridge from the bealach between Carn Macoul and Carn Dearg. Apparently this was filled with a considerable amount of avalanche debris. The remainder of the group ascended the snow slopes to the South East summit. Myself, Andy, Jan and Nev were looking to 'play' a little with our axes and went straight up the snow field buried behind the nose. It was a very steep climb, but I wouldn't say that it was prohibitively difficult at any point. We were the last to arrive on the ridge, having time only to take a few pictures before heading over to the South East summit.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This point of the day was like being in heaven, wandering around on a white ridge with blue sky everywhere. The view extended considerably in all directions.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We followed the ridge over the South East summit, 923m, to the true summit of Carn Dearg at 945m, and proceeded on to the 942m summit of Carn Ban. We followed the fence posts from here over the 920m top of Carn Ballach, to the 906m top of Meall na Creughaich and then the 911m summit of Meall a' Bhothain.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>At this point it became apparent that a group were heading off to get in Carn Sgulain, and I intended to follow suit. I ran out of gas on the 908m unnamed summit approximately 1km to the West of it, and decided to scrap the idea and just take in A' Chailleach.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Somewhere in the descent to Coire Dubh I really ran into a bit of a wall and decided that I wasn't strong enough to go up A' Chailleach, and it beat me again. I had completed the whole of this walk to this point on one Snickers bar - not bad for 40p! A couple of bars later I felt fine again, but it was too late by now to ascend up to A' Chailleach.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The descent through Coire Dubh was not very pleasant. The snow was largely about two foot deep, but was hollow at the base. Each step broke straight through to the bottom, and the icy base of the snow layer was tearing away at the shins when you stepped up. This caused some trepidation later in the week when I came back for A' Chailleach. It was almost dark by the time we arrived at the stalker's hut, and we descended Glen Chaorainn in the dark. I was quite pleased to have the old Petzl in my 'sac.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Fortunately we were able to advise the others at the hotel in advance of our forthcoming lateness, and we did not sit down for tea until 19:30, after taking in a quick shower. It was with some disappointment that a walk of this distance - 24km, had heralded only one Munro. I am currently consoling myself with the fact that it did include another 3 Tops, of which Carn Ban and Carn Ballach were Munros until 1980. I was also disappointed to have broken a trekking pole rather early in the day.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:gallery

				"content_text": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>My plans for Monday were made somewhat simpler by the fact that I could not find anyone insane enough to attempt A'Chailleach with me. It was a relatively small team that made a beeline for the Monadhliath Graham of Creag Liath, consisting of myself, Steve, John, Mike and Emily.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The route was the brainchild of Steve, and one has to remark that it was a rather good choice, although it did mean that my duel with A'Chailleach would have to wait another day.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We left 'The Lodge' at about 08:30. Various cumulative factors defined our low expectations on departure. Although the wind had dropped from the Sunday, it was still of considerable strength, certainly in excess of 30mph at height. I addition a considerable amount of snow had fallen - probably in the region of about 2 foot in 48 hours. This accumulation of powder snow we found very hard to walk through.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We made better progress initially as the conditions were far superior to the previous day, and just got better as the day continued, until the very end of it. We were up at the car park in about half an hour today, where we paused to take photographs of the 'snow family' that we would walk past all week, and which would only disappear on the Thursday evening.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We followed the track along the River Calder until we came to Glenbanchor and the disused farm. We turned right here before the bridge heading up the fields towards Glen Fionndrigh. At this point until the very end of the day we were walking almost virgin snow. Only one set of prints were ahead of ours, but these were inadequate and we had to break trail for the whole route.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The weather was very unpredictable, at times we were in a blizzard, and at others we were walking in perfect sunshine. It was in Glen Fionndrigh were Nev and Anne left us, having accompanied us that far, though as far as I know they hadn't intended to climb with us that day.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As soon as we reached the footbridge and the bealach I knew that we would attain our target that day, I don't back down when I'm that close unless I have to, and I didn't feel at this point that anything other than myself could cost me this summit.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>At the bealach we dug some seats in the snow and ate lunch before proceeding up onto the North ridge of Creag Liath. We walked along this ridge for maybe half an hour before climbing up to the summit at 743m. From here we proceeded to the South West summit at 732m before heading due South to Glen Banchor.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>From the South summit we descended as quickly as we could to Glen Banchor. We were more than aware that there was a big snow cloud closing in on us pretty quickly, and we raced down waist deep snow.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When we reached the base of the mountain there was some dispute as to which way we should proceed - should we head to the River Calder, or to the forest on Allt Fionndrigh. Somewhat nonchalant about the debate Emily and I headed for the forest in a somewhat undemocratic approach to route selection. We were some way ahead of the others, and for a large period of time no one followed us over the last rise, and we became quite concerned. It turned out that Steve had found a river under the snow and was changing his trousers.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We enjoyed lunch at the farmhouse at Glenbanchor before heading back to the hotel, one of the few teams to have successfully climbed anything that day.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:gallery

We were in the blizzard with a wind on the tops of about 80mph, we decided to launch an attempt on the Monadhliath Munro of A' Chailleach.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I don't think anybody that was with me on the Sunday morning would object to my opinion that with retrospect this was slightly over-ambitious. Andy and Jan turned back almost immediately. In fact, I hadn't known that they had started the walk. Sarah and Phil turned back before we reached the top car park, Anne turned back at the car park, and Emily shortly after.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Myself, Nev and Mike battled on for a wee while longer, but it was quite apparent that we would not summit anything that day. About half a mile beyond the car park at most we turned back, at about 10:30. I had thought that we had made decent progress all morning, but later experience through the week would reveal this walk to be one not longer than 20 minutes!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We caught up with Emily almost immediately, though I suspect that she may have anticipated our early demise and awaited our return, and enjoyed a semi-pleasant walk back to the hotel where the rest of the club were waiting to rain snowballs upon us. I was disappointed not to summit, but selfishly I was quite happy to discover that no other members of the party had summited anything that day. Not that I am a competitive sort.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The photographs taken in the afternoon appear quite serene, but the wind would keep its' strength throughout the day. We went in to Newtonmore seeking food but the cafe was shut, and the pub seemed a little expensive. So being the tight git that I am I went back to the room and ate a tin of Sardines, and began to plan for the Monday</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The plan for the monday was to get our own back on A'Chailleach, don't really like being beat.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:gallery

				"content_text": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I had a fantastic day today, which I think goes with the territory in Langdale. We set off from West Bromwich on the coach at 7am as usual, heading north on the M6 after picking up the dingle brigade at Penkridge. The weather hardly looked promising on the way North, and it rained quite heavily for the majority of the journey. After the obligatory pause on the Thelwall Viaduct we were soon eating very expensive Ginsters pasties at Charnock Richard Services.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We dropped a bunch off at Ambleside, and others at Chapel Stile. I had originally intended to get off at Ambleside and do the Fairfield Horseshoe. However, I decided during my journey that I really can not continue to avoid scrambles at all cost. I decided to go with the led walk and go for Jack's Rake.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We arrived at the New Dungeon Ghyll for about 10:45am, and spent some time getting kit together,visiting the little girls room and the like before heading off up alongside Stickle Ghyll.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The path alongside Stickle Ghyll is quite a pleasant one, rising at a comfortable gradient at all times. I was far too hot, the weather forecast predicting sub-zero temperatures driving me in to full winter gear. The coldest it got all day was about 5¬∞C and that was on the tops, but I may be totally wrong. Didn't feel a wind at all either, which I was probably quite grateful for on the scramble.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We came to the top of Stickle Ghyll, having forded it some time earlier, this task itself being somewhat easier in bombproof winter boots. Pavey Ark and the dam at Stickle Tarn came in to view at pretty much the same time. The line of Jack's Rake is quite obvious from here, as depicted in the photographs. Not really wanting to sit around looking at it for too long we decided to crack on</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We ambled over to the base of the scramble, and I have to admit that I felt quite nervous by the time we arrived there. I put into practice the first lesson from Blencathra in the summer - don't go last. It was a lesson well learnt as the narrative shall depict.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I found Jack's Rake a harder scramble by far than Sharp Edge, although Sharp Edge on a wet and windy day would be more difficult than when I crossed it. However, I did find two moves quite difficult here, whereas I found no difficult moves on Sharp Edge. The first of these was a boulder leaving a gap of about a foot to the cliff. With there being no apparent holds here I eventually resorted to jamming myself into this crack and shimmying upwards. The second was towards the top of the scramble, a high slab that it was difficult to get on to in the wet, and quite high for a midget like me. Eventually I just pulled myself on to it, and used the cracks in the slab for support while moving up it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Some of those further back were a considerable distance behind, and I was glad not to be stuck behind them. On the scramble I think that I was more concerned about the possibility of someone in front falling, or dislodging a rock on to me, than I was of actually falling myself.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Nevertheless I was grateful when the end of the scramble appeared, and we could take a breather. After about ten minutes the guy behind me emerged, followed by a couple who had overtaken the rest of our party. Another fifteen minutes would pass before anybody else emerged over the top of that last boulder.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As we were sat around waiting I decided to bimble off on to the 700m summit of Pavey Ark, where we bumped into John and Geoff who had been over High Raise and Sergeant Man. And had convinced me that Mike would not take in all the tops, so I decided to head off with John and Geoff to 'bag' the Pikes.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Not long after setting off I managed to make my obligatory excursion into a bog. This was actually the deepest I had fell yet, sinking immediately to waist depth, and struggling a little to excavate myself. Before too long we were on Harrison Stickle, and as we looked over to Pavey Ark we could see the last of the led walk topping out onto Pavey Ark. It would be some time before they left.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Under the 736m summit of Harrison stickle we found Iris and Ray, who we talked to momentarily before heading off towards Pike of Stickle. The ascent of this appears very steep from the East, and although the route is not as severe as it looks, we did have a mini scramble up on to it. Although we later found the path that we had missed, it is difficult to get up without use of hands.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As we arrived at the 709m summit we were joined by Andy and Jan, who had skirted around Harrison Stickle. I decided to head off to Loft Crag with them, as I knew that they would take a path down, and not the nearest scree slope that bottomed out at a pub! We arrived at the 670m summit of Loft Craft, and headed back down to the col and civilisation. Again dropping off this top we found ourselves scrambling a little, though there was a path that we later found.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We had been briefly rejoined by John and Geoff, but they descended a ridge to the right of the path we were on. We dropped straight down to the New Dungeon Ghyll, and unable to get on the coach to change though we had better have a pint. Thoroughly enjoyed today, and didn't pull any muscles despite wearing the winter boots. Off to Newtonmore on Saturday morning, bring it on!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:gallery

Didn't really want to spoil the ending, but the title is a bit of a give-away, I actually stood on top of a hill today!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I think for the large part the photographs do more justice to todays walk than any words I could possibly conjure up, but I will provide a short narrative.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Leaving the hostel at Bridges after packing our kit, we left on a long road walk up to a farm at the foot of Stiperstones. We ascended past this and onto a crossroads on the ridge proper.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Having three options at this point I decide to go off exploring an area of old mines, others went straight to the pub, and Steve went off over the Stiperstones and headed back to the hostel for an early start home.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The plan again was to ascend the Stiperstones on our return. Due to a delay serving food in the pub, this was not for some time. After about an hour in the pub the others had been fed, and we set off on a steep reascent upto the Stiperstones.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Almost immediately on this ascent I slipped, and my knee crashed down onto what was quite possibly the only rock in this area. This was very painful initialy as signified by an exrtion of expletives on my part. Rod carried my rucksack for about the next half hour, and thankfully the pain eased, and I was able to maintain pace with the rest of the group.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Once we attained the ridge once more the ground became somewhat rockier, and I kept jarring my leg on the rocks. This brought visions of \"Touching the Void\" to the fore, and almost inevitably \"Brown Girl in the Ring\" by Boney M became stuck in my head. Think I might have to buy a new DVD to watch!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The Stiperstones can only be fully completed with a small scramble on some rocks. I was quite concerned, as obviously I was in a lot of pain in the one leg. It wasn't a difficult decision to make, scrambling up these lovely rocks. There was no way I was going on a third consecutive climb without attaing the top, I was up like a shot! Must be getting younger for anyone who said I was getting old last week. Bar Stewards!!!!!!!!!!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The walk out was essentially a very long road walk, as the walk in had been, but by 16:30 we were in the car, and in Shrewsbury before dark. We made it back to the Midlands somewhat easier, though it did take a couple of attempts to succesfully find my way out of Shrewsbury.<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:gallery

The plan was to take the country road that runs from Shrewsbury to Bridges, which I did evntually do after a detour northbound on the A49, but we did arrive in the end with sufficient time to devour a sirloin steak in the horshoes Inn.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The hostel itself was great, if a little regimented, I had to wonder what might have happened to me had I tried to escape! I got to bed about midnight on the Friday night, but didn't really sleep a great deal.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Getting up at about 7am we had ample time to consume breakfast before departure around 09:15. We initially ambled along a country road before taking to a field, and the open countryside. We had a nice steady walk along the fields before the walk became somewhat steeper, and before long we emerged on the ridge and were at Pole Cottage.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We set off after a short break heading down to Little Stretton, intending to head up to Pole Bank on our return. Unfortunately events would conspire to prevent me getting there, but I wasn't too disappointed as I broke my duck the next day. Before too long the predicted snow began to fall from the sky, and before we knew it we were sat in the Ragleth Inn.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After some time in the pub we set off, and it was instantly obvious that the weather had turned. Indeed as we reascended the Long Mynd this worsened, with visibility down to around 10m by the time we reached Pole Cottage.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Having reached Pole Cottage it became apparent that a couple of members of the party had not caught us up after a detour on route, and initial searches had not located them. I stayed on top with a few buddies, whilst the rest of the party went to Pole Bank and descended back to the Youth Hostel. By 16:30 it was clear that our searches had proved fruitless, and we left one member of the party at the cottage whilst we drove a car off the hill, and made enquiries at Bridges. With no information we drove back up to the top, it getting quite dark by now, intending to call for help if they had not appeared.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When we arrived on top news had just emerged that the two missing walkers were at the hostel having walked off the hill, and we headed straight for a warm shower, but the Marilyn will have to wait!</p>\n<!--

We headed off up the public right of way through Penrhyn Slate Quarries, only to be confronted by a security guard pointing to a sign stating that the right of way would be closed for 15 years from 2002. He didnt seem too amused when we told him that we would wait. Miserable git.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>On the way back I took a photograph of the weir at Ogwen bank, before we finally set off through a gate onto a track we had looked at some time ago. The rain was torrential for large parts of the day, but the new jacket performed well, the trousers did let a little rainwater through though, bugger.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We eventually came to a gate where we took to the open hillside heading up to Carnedd y Filiast. Although it was a steep hill, I was really unhappy with how it felt, the legs being very heavy, and just generally struggling. Eventually I turned back with Bob, Steve, and another gentleman that I met up at Wasdale Head, couldn't tell you his name, but I do know that he has a dog called Henry, bizarely enough.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I had assumed that when we turned back we were about 50m. below the 721m. point on the ridge. Looking at the map, I know that on descent the scree headed inlet was to my left, which means that I was just belo Carnedd y Filiast itself, and a relatively level ridge walk. In reality I missed out on a couple of hours working away in a cloud with no views when I was already struggling. The plan had been to drop off the ridge from the Devils Kitchen, but even those who persisted dropped off after Foel-goch, and pretty much everyone else cut their walks short. I wish I had gone for Moel Siabod instead, because I think that I would have got myself up knowing that I could go straight back down again!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The only major saving point for the day is that despite the weather I have got a couple of decent photographs on descent, but I think it takes me back to my point last week about expectation, if you expect a great day it simply never happens - you can't demand great weather in Ogwen in summer, never mind winter (If that is what you could call this). Just ignore me, I'm more miserable a git than the security guard at the quarry today, and my legs hurt, and I don't understand why!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:gallery {\"ids\":[1880,1881,1882,1883,1884,1885,1886,1887],\"columns\":4} -->\n<ul class=\"wp-block-gallery columns-4 is-cropped\"><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"https://leeperry.micro.blog/uploads/2023/86a883ea81.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"1880\" data-link=\"https://lee-perry.co.uk/exploring/mountain-walks/an-abortive-attempt-on-the-glyderau/attachment/dscn0140/\" class=\"wp-image-1880\"/></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"https://leeperry.micro.blog/uploads/2023/acb255c093.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"1881\" data-link=\"https://lee-perry.co.uk/exploring/mountain-walks/an-abortive-attempt-on-the-glyderau/attachment/dscn0142/\" class=\"wp-image-1881\"/></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"https://leeperry.micro.blog/uploads/2023/a629946de0.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"1882\" data-link=\"https://lee-perry.co.uk/exploring/mountain-walks/an-abortive-attempt-on-the-glyderau/attachment/dscn0143/\" class=\"wp-image-1882\"/></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"https://leeperry.micro.blog/uploads/2023/9182c37a34.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"1883\" data-link=\"https://lee-perry.co.uk/exploring/mountain-walks/an-abortive-attempt-on-the-glyderau/attachment/dscn0144/\" class=\"wp-image-1883\"/></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"https://leeperry.micro.blog/uploads/2023/c722a92dc0.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"1884\" data-link=\"https://lee-perry.co.uk/exploring/mountain-walks/an-abortive-attempt-on-the-glyderau/attachment/dscn0145/\" class=\"wp-image-1884\"/></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"https://leeperry.micro.blog/uploads/2023/0f64facb88.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"1885\" data-link=\"https://lee-perry.co.uk/exploring/mountain-walks/an-abortive-attempt-on-the-glyderau/attachment/dscn0146/\" class=\"wp-image-1885\"/></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"https://leeperry.micro.blog/uploads/2023/12ee5a65c4.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"1886\" data-link=\"https://lee-perry.co.uk/exploring/mountain-walks/an-abortive-attempt-on-the-glyderau/attachment/dscn0147/\" class=\"wp-image-1886\"/></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"https://leeperry.micro.blog/uploads/2023/c4164a3b67.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"1887\" data-link=\"https://lee-perry.co.uk/exploring/mountain-walks/an-abortive-attempt-on-the-glyderau/attachment/dscn0148/\" class=\"wp-image-1887\"/></figure></li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:gallery -->\n",

				"content_text": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Its kinda funny how when you build up to a great day in Ogwen or Keswick it often doesn't live up to the expectation created beforehand, yet when you least expect to have a really great day out it jumps up and whacks you on the nose. This was one of those days, had a ball.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I didn't really expect much of the Clwydian Hills to be quite honest, I knew that I wouldn't be on anything huge today, I also knew that I was not going to tick any more Nuttalls. I suppose I had the perception that todays walk would be almost entirely social, and there would be little emphasis on the hills themselves.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I am very happy to say that I was wrong on all accounts. The hills were absolutely fantastic, and we put in nearly 1000m of ascent I would imagine, quickly glancing at the map which I created from several Jpegs 'borrowed' from the getamap service the previous evening. The meet too was not entirely social, although I enjoyed walking with people that I would not normally do so.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We set off from West Bromwich at about 09:20, having a somewhat later start than a normal meet would involve. We arrived at Loggerheads at about 11:30, and spent a few moments gathering our gear before we set off on a very long looking walk to Moel Famau. At virtually all points during the walk today Moel Famau was apparent as the highest land in the area. We continued along a dirt track until we came to a fence by a house with a right of way sign pointing towards a gate.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>At this point we took to a muddy track, skirting right at a brook, and proceeded across several fields until we came to a field with no apparent exit. There was quite clearly a bridleway at the top of the field, and it was the route that we required, yet there was no obvious route on to it. John Rod and I scaled the fence, but I being by far the shorter of the three happened to be the one to catch the barbed wire in quite a painful area. On crossing the fence it became apparent that there was a gap approximately 100m further down the field, and the remainder of the group came through that, although we were quite widely spread at this point and I did not see the rear of the group which would only catch uop with us at the summit of Moel Famau.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We followed the bridleway on which we had landed for only about 10m before again skirting off the track and in to the open fields to the right. We ploughed through the fields, which were very muddy and obviously a path of some description judging by the number of footprints ahead. For some time we continued through these fields until we came to a track that skirted around the forests on Moel Famau. The ascent of the hill from here seemed to take forever, and my legs felt very heavy, although I kept up a good pace being amongst the first group to make it up. I was somewhat surprised that my hamstring hadn't already gone, although I had opted for the three season boots today rather than four.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It was incredibly windy on top of Moel Famau, the summit being 554m. On ascending the Jubilee Tower one landed in a sort of vaccuum. On descending the tower, at one point, the wind blew me part way back up. I was glad to reach the shelter below and have a bite to eat. I tested out my new winter coattoday which I will be taking to Newtonmore in February, but it was really too warm for today, and I drank a considerable amount of fluid for a half day walk and still felt somewhat dehydrated towards the end.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After perhaps 20 minutes on top we left, having arrived at about 12:30. We proceeded straight down the Offa's Dyke path in the general direction of Foel Fenlli which we could see rising off to the left. At a juncture we took a diversion to the left taking to the open hillside, we took a track to the left that petered out, and dropped down to the original track on which we had been. At this point we contoured around the corner, taking in the drop toBwlch Penbarras, and a very steep rise up to Foel Fenlli.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I was very concerned about this steep slope, expecting the hamstring to go at any point. The path up was not obvious on descent, buit when we reached the Bwlch Foel Fenlli was quite clearly marked, and you simply follow a track through some zig zags. I wasn't nearly so fast going up Foel Fenlli, and was not quite able to keep up with the lead group. I was again very pleased that my hamstring did not go on this section, although the third hill would turn out to be steeper! I arrived on top only a couple of minutes after the two Johns, Mike and Rod, and again the wind was quite fierce on top. When Emily came up and started ascending the cairn it appeared for a moment as though it may blow her over, though it never quite achieved this.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I hadn't anticipated the walk down from Foel Fenlli being quite so long as it was, We followed a series of very muddy tracks through fields until we eventually emerged at The Forge. We had arrived at the 511m summit of Foel Fenlli at approximately 14:30, so clearly we had been making good time. It was not a difficult decision to persist on to Moel Gyw. Turning right at the roaf juncture, and then almost immediately left, we followed a private road for perhaps 400m before finding a signposted right of way for Moel Gyw. We followed this to the foot of the hill where we were met by a large area of heather. With retrospect there are several easier routes to the summit than the one we chose. You can skirt the fence avoiding the worst of the bracken, or you can extend the walk to ascend a good path from the South. On finding the heather we immediately began to contour through it. Myself and Emily could not keep up with John, Mike and Rod, and t'other John soon caught up with us. We seemed to going nowhere. Eventually John headed straight up through the bracken and I followed suit, Emily continued to contour around falling over continually. At this point Mike Smith arrived at the bottom of the section of heather, and immediately turned with his tail between his legs, scared off by a few plants. I just hope there arent any weeds growing on Crib Goch when we do the 3000s. I must rub it in, don't get the chance very often!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Eventually the gradient lessened and before long we reached the summit trig point where there was a collapsed antenna of some description. The lead group had contoured on to a path which we would later use for descent. Before long Emily joined us on top, and we paused only momentarilly before the first drops of rain of the day began to fall. We raced back down through the fields to The Forge staying largely dry and being quite forunate to escape the downpour that began as we arrived back at the coach. We promptly got changed and ate a giant carvery in the pub. Must say thanks to Andy Brown for organising a wicked event, even if he does criticise my photogrphically challenged attempts at taking decent piccies!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:gallery

				"content_text": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Paul picked me up in the morning at about 0630 at M6J10. A little concerned by drastic weather forecasts predicting more snow and ice on the roads than in an arctic winter we were not too sure whether to head to our intended target at Pistyll Rhaeadr, or to stop at Church Stretton and do Caer Caradoc.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As we passed Telford we were struck by quite a heavy rainstorm, but as we passed the cloud it quickly became apparent that we had just gone through the only cloud in the sky. Our early pessimism soon mothballed in to warm enthusiasm. The conversation for the rest of the journey dominated by the views that we expected to have. It was an easy decision to make to head over to Pistyll Rhaeadr.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As we arrived at Pistyll Rhaeadr at 0815 the first clouds began to emerge. It was quite disheartening, as the sky had been clear for the entire journey. We found a parking place, which was quite easy as we were the first arrivals of the day. We then wandered up to the waterfall, and found a track to take us up to the valley from which it fell. I didn't expect a great deal of the waterfall to be honest, but it was pretty impressive, shame about it being 20 mile too far west though.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The track up from the car park was very icy which I did find a little worrying, but we took our time on the way up, and as soon as we were off the track at the top we never had a problem with ice again all day....ha! We had planned to follow the Nuttall book route on Post Gwyn and then head up on to the main Berwyn ridge. We quickly decided that if we could ford the brook we could save quite a considerable amount of time. We walked along Afon Disgynfa for some time until we gained the confidence to jump across. A quick height test revealed that it was deeper than my trekking pole, very cold, and moving quite quickly. You certainly would not have wanted to fall at this point.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We arrived safely on the other bank of the stream and headed up Cwm Gloywfa towards Post Gwyn. This section of the route took longer than we had anticipated. We spent a large quantity of time fighting against the heather, until eventually we emerged on a plateau with a rise directly in front of us that was clearly the summit area. This after crossing a fence that has grown somewhat since the map was drawn. Even descending to the base of the rise was quite heavy work in the heather. When we weren't fighting heather we were fighting log grass with boggy ground below.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>At times on this ascent we had been treated to every condition the British winter can throw at you -snow, sleet, hail, and scorching sunshine. As we crossed the summit area we saw a rainbow directly in front of Moel Sych dropping down to the Afon Disgynfa. We fought our way around the heather to the head of the valley, and crossed the valley bottom, reascending on the other side towards Moel Sych, which had already spent most of the morning in the cloud. We had submitted Post Gwyn at about 1000, by 1130 we had battled our way through approximately a mile of heather and long grass, and were on the main ridge. We paused here for a few minutes to have some coffee and to catch glimpses of the snow covered Arenigs under the clouds. We could see quite clearly by this point that Moel Sych was in quite a considerable snow cloud.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The path along the Berwyn ridge was quite good in winter condition, though one would imagine that it would be like crossing a large bog in summer. On many occasions I broke through the ice on which I was walking, indeed on one occasion my fall was broken only by a very painful region striking the ground. This did not continue for too long though, as the ice quickly became thicker as we ascended. As we ascended in to this zone we met our first human of the day, a gentleman from Halesowen who had slept in his car on the pass. Not long after this visibility began to reduce, and by the time we were on the 827m summit of Moel Sych it had all but disappeared. Paul on the summit cairn of Moel Sych.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We paused only for a moment before plodding on to Cadair Berwyn. We stopped only momentarily here before heading for the shelter below. It was quit dark and very cold at this point. We had only seen one other person all day, so I was quite startled when two people from Shrewsbury entered the shelter about 30 seconds after us. I was quite bemused that they were eating. I had not eaten all day, but I certainly wasn't about to take the gloves off. I looked briefly over the parapet in an attempt to take a photograph of Cadair Berwyn, but it was simply too dark. Within ten minutes of leaving the shelter we were on the top of the old summit. Not pausing to take a picture we immediately turned in to the wind and hail, and battled our way back to Moel Sych.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We headed stright down the ridge, though never found the 'path' the runs straight down the middle of it. We ended up descending Cwm-Rhiwiau, battling through the heather all the way down, and even when we reached the valley floor were unsuccessful in our attempts to find a consistent path. We arrived back at the bottom of the waterfall at 1500, very hungry, and very thirsty. We hadn't been able to eat all day, and I had run out of Lucozade before we had ascended Moel Sych the first time. Everytime I go to the local Sainsbury's their supply of isotonic seems to be depleted by exactly the amount that I took on my last visit, this time they had but a measly litre. I hope they have ordered some more by now! I was understandably very happy to see the cafe at the foot of the waterfall was open, and drank a giant pot of tea, and ate a fantastic jacket potato. I was somewhat bemused on leaving the cafe as to the sign on the gate which read 'Do not let the goat in.' My bemusement promptly ceased when the goat joined me in the gents!<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:gallery

				"content_text": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>An evening of heavy snow saw me feeling very optimistic about having a great day today. Although I wasn't surrounded by the white fields that I had hoped for I did get clear skies, views for miles, and some great photographs. The pictures taken today kick the butt off of anything that I have taken previously, so I guess I must be getting used to using the filters.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I didn't set off from Walsall till about 11:00, having to get to my Gran's to pick the car up from last night. There was still a good couple of inches of snow on the ground at this point, so I decided to take my axe to pose with! I set off for the M6, immediately getting lost and driving around Bloxwich for a period of time. It didn't take a massive amount of time until I was on the motorway heading South. I was quite bemused as I went past the hill I had previously assumed to be Clent and had a view of from my old office at Merry Hill. On checking the map it transpires that this is in fact Turner's Hill.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I parked up by a mass of other cars by the visitor centre at Nimings Wood. I couldn't place myself on the map (even with the help of the map at the Visitor centre). A kind gentleman told me I was at the car park about half a km down the road from where I actually was. This didn't help, as my navigation while driving is absolutely awful. I placed myself eventually by examining the T-Junction by where I had parked.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I set off from the visitor centre at Nimings Wood, heading straight up the tourist trek on Clent Hill and following it up zig-zags that wouldn't look amiss on the Ben. I came to a viewpoint from where I took some initial photographs to the West and North, with the features marked on various stones. I proceeded onwards, eventually coming to the four stones monument. I didn't photograph the circle as there were about thirty people in the middle of it, and I had just spotted my objective for the day - Walton Hill.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Eventually the map began to make sense. I now rescind all previous assertions that 1:50k maps suffice outside of mountain regions, because mine was crap today..or was it me!!!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I was a little disappointed not to see any snow at all, and perhaps looked a little silly with my axe on the back of my sac. It was actually very slippery in the areas that had not been exposed to the sun, and I was glad to be wearing a 'proper' pair of boots. I descended off Clent Hill, gaining the road by the entrance to the visitor centre.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I steamed back down the road that I had followed everybody else up, past the car, and to the T-Junction at the end of the road. Examining the road signs I was able to place myself properly on the map for the first time. On my return I noticed that my car was only parked about 10m from this junction. I can't have been looking forwards when I arrived.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I turned right at the junction, and then left after about 100m, walking through an absolutely massive car park, and then picking up the track to the right that was to take me up on to Walton Hill.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>On entering the woodland there were two choices of routes up the hill, you could either take a treacherous looking set of steps up the hillside, or a winding path. I absolutely hate steps so took the winding path. After about 100m I realised that I have winding paths too, and promptly forced a route through some trees and then up the open hillside. On gaining the top I experienced my only moment of solitude of the day before several people came into view once more. I was quite surprised by how busy it was up there, 'spose everybody is on hols at the moment.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Despite the numbers on top it was a very pleasant walk along the hill. The skies were clear and blue, it was quite cool, the kind of day that you absolutely love, but never get. I soon found the trig point of the highest hill, 315m, in the West Midlands, and duly said hello to Marilyn.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I had intended to persist as far as Calcot Hill, and set off in that direction. Momentarily losing attention I followed the path that forked off to the right. I soon realised that I had lost too much height, and backtracked up to the joining of the paths. I was in two minds at this point as to if I should go on to Calcot Hill, but eventually decided to do so.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I followed the track until I came to Daleswood farm. I soon spotted the public footpath skirting to the left of the farm, passing the turnstile, and a second after another 100m. This put me out in to the open fields, and I saw my only snow of the day at this point. I came to a track that clearly regained height to Calcot Hill which was about 10m higher than where I was stood. There was a gate up on to the next field, and a couple of horses in the way. They looked a bit bigger than me, and I didn't have my Trangia with me to cook them on, so decided that I really couldn't be bothered walking between them, and turned back.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I retraced my steps back on to Walton Hill, which is something that I don't like doing, I much prefer circular routes. I descended via the treacherous looking staircase that I mentioned earlier, following behind a family that I caught up with in no time at all. Regaining the road I raced back to the car for a cuppa. It was at this point that I realised exactly how much washing up liquid was in the tea....eurggh!!!!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:gallery

				"content_text": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I left home at 6am yesterday morning highly excited by a weather forecast that said there would not be a cloud over the Beacons for three days, I think my photography quite irrevocably proves that it was wrong. That said I had a great day.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I spent most of the coach journey staring at a cloud that was simply not supposed to be there, remarking how much tinner it was getting the closer the hills became. I always was a bit of an optimist in this regard! When we disembarked from the coach we were most definitely in a cloud, although it seemed a fairly light one, so I was not too concerned about the weather, it would have been nice to enjoy a view for a change though.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I had intended to do a circular route from the Storey Arms, but changed my mind on the way in, opting for the linear traverse from Pencelli to the Storey Arms. I would imagine that on a fine day this would be an absolutely awesome ridge walk. I found the terrain very similiar to that on Bannau Sir Gaer a couple of months ago. The only grumble that I really could have is the erosion on the ridge, but I suppose that goes with the territory.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We were walking from Pencelli by about 10:00am, heading gently up Gist Wen. The intention had been to take the seven nuttalls on route, I only bagged a paltry four, which I am a little pissed about, but I guess they will still be there next time I visit. We deliberately followed the path around the first nuttall, Waun Rydd, deciding that it would not be easy to find the top with visibility at about 20m at that point. Having gained the ridge the first top was Bwlch y Ddwyallt, 754m, which I am fairly sure that I bagged, but not comprehensively so. Our GPS reading pointed to a high piece of peat which was certainly higher than the surrounding land. Can someone please let me know if I am wrong, I will go and find it next time then.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Having missed the first top, and not being wholly sure about the second one, you would have thought that I would have made absolutely damn sure about the third one, Fan y Big, especially with a name like that. So I accidentally walked past it! Alone I would have gone back and knocked the bugger off, but I was in a group which was running short of time, and not excessively enthusiastic about climbing back up to the col. The walk along Craig Cwareli was a very cold and windy one, I found myself in the unusual situation of wearing a third layer.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The situation became more confusing as we reached the 599m bealach between Fan y Big and Cribyn. We found ourselves in a giant whole in the cloud, and it were absolutely boiling. I was more than happy to shed a couple of layers. About ten minutes later we were back in the cloud again, and putting the layers back on!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The ascent of Cribyn from this point is fairly steep, and my left hamstring went again about halfway up the slope. I had my trekking poles today though, and used them to pretty much drag muyself up. Got on the ridge, and it was absolutely fine on the flat. We summited on Cribyn, 795m, and the drag up to Pen y Fan, 886m, just seemed to last an eternity. When we got to the top Mike decided to pull on a full Santa suit. Oh, my, god.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There had been talk of skirting Corn Du, 873m, but we went and stood on top for a moment or two before descending directly to the Storey Arms, thus missing out the last of our intended tops, Y Gyrn. The omission of this means, that barring a huge day out, I will need to make another two visits to mop up the ridge. Had an awesome day though, would definitely go back.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The coach was due to leave at 15:45, and we arrived at the Storey Arms a little beforehand, getting changed in the middle of the lane, and then we went to a pub up the road for some chips....and beer. Think I will probably have a week or two off now to let the hamstring heal, not!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:gallery {\"ids\":[1794,1795,1796,1797,1798,1799,1800,1801,1802,1803,1804,1805,1806],\"columns\":5} -->\n<ul class=\"wp-block-gallery columns-5 is-cropped\"><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"https://leeperry.micro.blog/uploads/2023/2d0c66ef99.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"1794\" data-link=\"https://lee-perry.co.uk/exploring/mountain-walks/traverse-of-the-brecon-beacons-from-pencelli-to-the-storey-arms/attachment/dscn0030/\" class=\"wp-image-1794\"/></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"https://leeperry.micro.blog/uploads/2023/d85cffcf74.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"1795\" data-link=\"https://lee-perry.co.uk/exploring/mountain-walks/traverse-of-the-brecon-beacons-from-pencelli-to-the-storey-arms/attachment/dscn0032/\" class=\"wp-image-1795\"/></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"https://leeperry.micro.blog/uploads/2023/28f4061bd9.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"1796\" data-link=\"https://lee-perry.co.uk/exploring/mountain-walks/traverse-of-the-brecon-beacons-from-pencelli-to-the-storey-arms/attachment/dscn0033/\" class=\"wp-image-1796\"/></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"https://leeperry.micro.blog/uploads/2023/99d88bab89.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"1797\" data-link=\"https://lee-perry.co.uk/exploring/mountain-walks/traverse-of-the-brecon-beacons-from-pencelli-to-the-storey-arms/attachment/dscn0037/\" class=\"wp-image-1797\"/></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"https://leeperry.micro.blog/uploads/2023/5bf8953be4.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"1798\" data-link=\"https://lee-perry.co.uk/exploring/mountain-walks/traverse-of-the-brecon-beacons-from-pencelli-to-the-storey-arms/attachment/dscn0039/\" class=\"wp-image-1798\"/></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"https://leeperry.micro.blog/uploads/2023/a5ee428d4c.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"1799\" data-link=\"https://lee-perry.co.uk/exploring/mountain-walks/traverse-of-the-brecon-beacons-from-pencelli-to-the-storey-arms/attachment/dscn0040/\" class=\"wp-image-1799\"/></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"https://leeperry.micro.blog/uploads/2023/39f1d9ee09.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"1800\" data-link=\"https://lee-perry.co.uk/exploring/mountain-walks/traverse-of-the-brecon-beacons-from-pencelli-to-the-storey-arms/attachment/dscn0041/\" class=\"wp-image-1800\"/></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"https://leeperry.micro.blog/uploads/2023/f3b26b6b34.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"1801\" data-link=\"https://lee-perry.co.uk/exploring/mountain-walks/traverse-of-the-brecon-beacons-from-pencelli-to-the-storey-arms/attachment/dscn0042/\" class=\"wp-image-1801\"/></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"https://leeperry.micro.blog/uploads/2023/c2fd9f7dce.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"1802\" data-link=\"https://lee-perry.co.uk/exploring/mountain-walks/traverse-of-the-brecon-beacons-from-pencelli-to-the-storey-arms/attachment/dscn0043/\" class=\"wp-image-1802\"/></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"https://leeperry.micro.blog/uploads/2023/aa7dd5f2a9.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"1803\" data-link=\"https://lee-perry.co.uk/exploring/mountain-walks/traverse-of-the-brecon-beacons-from-pencelli-to-the-storey-arms/attachment/dscn0044/\" class=\"wp-image-1803\"/></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"https://leeperry.micro.blog/uploads/2023/0f289eb9bf.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"1804\" data-link=\"https://lee-perry.co.uk/exploring/mountain-walks/traverse-of-the-brecon-beacons-from-pencelli-to-the-storey-arms/attachment/dscn0046/\" class=\"wp-image-1804\"/></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"https://leeperry.micro.blog/uploads/2023/21e74469c5.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"1805\" data-link=\"https://lee-perry.co.uk/exploring/mountain-walks/traverse-of-the-brecon-beacons-from-pencelli-to-the-storey-arms/attachment/dscn0048/\" class=\"wp-image-1805\"/></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"https://leeperry.micro.blog/uploads/2023/84747752e2.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"1806\" data-link=\"https://lee-perry.co.uk/exploring/mountain-walks/traverse-of-the-brecon-beacons-from-pencelli-to-the-storey-arms/attachment/dscn0049/\" class=\"wp-image-1806\"/></figure></li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:gallery -->\n",

I picked Paul up in West Bromwich at about 05:50 this morning and set off up the M6 and the M54. I hadn't really decided how much I was going to climb today, having felt pretty rough since Friday. Only when we pulled up at Dobbies did we decide that we would go to the Arans after all, but do a much shorther walk.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We set off up on to Glasgwm with the mountain well and truly in the cloud, contrary to the forecast. We worked our way up the valley, which we had to ourselves the whole day, except momentarily when another group began to catch us. The weather was fairly decent all day, but we didn't have the views that we had hoped for. We found our way on to the main Aran ridge somewhat quicker than we expected, and of course it was not long before we were on the summit of Glasgwm at 780m. The lake just beyond the summit, Llyn y Fign is most impressive, but I had just put my gloves on, and really couldn't be arsed to take a picture, the sweeping cloud would have spoiled any shot anyway.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We found the lake quite disorienting, and neither of us were expecting it to be where it was. It looked immense, and momentarilly there appeared to be no route around it. From here we trundled quite happily along on the ridge until we came to the forest. We were quite confused by the forest to start with, as we could not see the fire breech that we would need to use for the descent later. The summit cairn of Glasgwm, 780m. Paul topping out on Pen y Brynfforchog, 685m.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Eventually we established our location, found the breech, and continued to the second Nuttall, Pen y Brynfforchog (685m). We were confused again by the location of the summit, that was just a small pile of slates, and then we lost the path very briefly on our return to the breech.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The forest was very boggy and wet, and barely descended, in fact we seemed to gain more height than we lost. Eventually we came out of the forest after a break, and descended quite steeply back to the car down what appeared to be an old slate mine track.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I really enjoyed myself, even though I didn't feel great today.

There were hordes of people on their way up in trainers, jeans, track suits, leather jackets etc. Some Canadian tourists bumped in to some WBMC members who had just gone over Crib Goch and Crib y Ddysgl, asking if they were nearly at the summit of Mount Snowdon. When they were told rather curtly that they were on the wrong top they rather wisely decided to descend - but over Crib Goch (-:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Anyway, rant over for all of another paragraph, I had decided on the coach that I would decide whether to go for Crib Goch or up the Pyg track at Bwlch y Moch. I looked at the sharp ascent up to the ridge, and just felt that I would be far too slow, and didn't want to risk aggravating the thigh strain gained on the Brecons last week (which I did anyway). We proceeded up the Pyg track, which has a nice easy gradient all the way to the top - not dissimilar to the path from Glenriddings to Raise. We knew that at about 950m we would be entering a cloud as Crib Goch was clear - but only just. As we got nearer to the cloud it got colder, and suddenly snow started to appear on the ground.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It was not at all long after this that we topped out at Bwlch Glas. The Llanberis path that we picked up reminded me of exactly why I had avoided this mountain for so long. You could quite easily get my gearboxless Punto up it, well this section in any case. The photos show how much snow was lying on the ground and flying around in the air. It was not too slippy until we neared the summit, and even then only the final 5 or 10 metres of ascent were quite treacherous. I met one couple who had never climbed before, who had got this far, but just could not get up the spiral staircase on to the very top.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I slowly clambered up to the trig point, being joined quite soon after by Barbara and Anthony. Maybe the key to climbing Snowdon is not getting up at 5am as we had in July! Having said all that I have of disliking this mountain, I did feel a massive amount of satisfaction, even vengeance, for completing what I had turned back on in July.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The cafe was shut, I thought that I was being wound up on the ascent, but no, it was shut. We had lunch in the snow, using the cafe as a windbreak. It was -¬∞5 with the windchill on the summit. This was the first time in a long while that I had not felt cold on a mountain. I wore gloves, which I have not done since Cadair Idris last march, and I also wore my fleece ski balaclava. I wore a fleece lined pair of salopettes which were absolutely wicked (thats excellent for the older gen.) and didn't overheat at all, which I feared that I might - not bad for ¬£29.99 from TK Max.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We weren't going to be hanging around on the summit for long, we had arrived on top at about 13:15, we left at about 13:30, heading straight back in to the wind. My body didn't feel cold, on top I only had my windshield and a thermal base layer, but I could feel the wind biting in to my face. The group split in to 2 here. One group decided to head back down the Llanberis bath and sit in a cafe all arvo. Us younger ones decided to go and bag a Marilyn on the way in to Llanberis.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We came to a junction on the Snowdon Ranger where we could either walk around a hill, or walk over it. It just had to be bagged. I knew it had to at least be a marilyn, just by its appearance, and that it was also probably a nuttall. The hill was Moel Cynghorion, and the incline was agony. It was on this incline that I aggraved the thigh strain. I could only move about 5 steps upwards before I had to stop again. Eventually I got to the top, and we descended down to Llanberis. I was fine on the level and downhill, but even the slightest uphill movement was hurting. Fortunately there was very little uphill movement hereafter.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Eventually we arrived in Llanberis, and I had managed to keep up with Mike and Emily, which is an achievement at the best of times. We went in to the Quality hotel there, I think it was called the Victoria. The driveway must have been built especially for me, it was bloody agony, I was overtaken by an old local on a stick! An awesome day, though I do feel rather sore today, I did enjoy it, which I didn't expect. Camera is still playing up, it only seems to like the memory card in the house. It works fine here, but when I get it on a hill it only has a capacity of 20 on my normal resolution, whereas it should be 80! I'll be asking Argos very kindly to provide me with a replacement next weekend pending investment in one that kicks some serious butt.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:gallery {\"ids\":[1762,1763,1764,1765,1766,1767,1768,1769,1770,1771,1772,1773,1774],\"columns\":5} -->\n<ul class=\"wp-block-gallery columns-5 is-cropped\"><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"https://leeperry.micro.blog/uploads/2023/0f7a5dbe01.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"1762\" data-link=\"https://lee-perry.co.uk/exploring/mountain-walks/ascent-of-snowdon/attachment/dsci0001-14/\" class=\"wp-image-1762\"/></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"https://leeperry.micro.blog/uploads/2023/c28c15f22e.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"1763\" data-link=\"https://lee-perry.co.uk/exploring/mountain-walks/ascent-of-snowdon/attachment/dsci0002-14/\" class=\"wp-image-1763\"/></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"https://leeperry.micro.blog/uploads/2023/d0e050a0ea.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"1764\" data-link=\"https://lee-perry.co.uk/exploring/mountain-walks/ascent-of-snowdon/attachment/dsci0003-14/\" class=\"wp-image-1764\"/></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"https://leeperry.micro.blog/uploads/2023/51162464b5.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"1765\" data-link=\"https://lee-perry.co.uk/exploring/mountain-walks/ascent-of-snowdon/attachment/dsci0004-13/\" class=\"wp-image-1765\"/></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"https://leeperry.micro.blog/uploads/2023/11adc73160.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"1766\" data-link=\"https://lee-perry.co.uk/exploring/mountain-walks/ascent-of-snowdon/attachment/dsci0005-12/\" class=\"wp-image-1766\"/></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"https://leeperry.micro.blog/uploads/2023/ae45e42596.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"1767\" data-link=\"https://lee-perry.co.uk/exploring/mountain-walks/ascent-of-snowdon/attachment/dsci0006-13/\" class=\"wp-image-1767\"/></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"https://leeperry.micro.blog/uploads/2023/851711e1af.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"1768\" data-link=\"https://lee-perry.co.uk/exploring/mountain-walks/ascent-of-snowdon/attachment/dsci0007-10/\" class=\"wp-image-1768\"/></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"https://leeperry.micro.blog/uploads/2023/0eedb6fe9d.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"1769\" data-link=\"https://lee-perry.co.uk/exploring/mountain-walks/ascent-of-snowdon/attachment/dsci0008-11/\" class=\"wp-image-1769\"/></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"https://leeperry.micro.blog/uploads/2023/0a89e16e11.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"1770\" data-link=\"https://lee-perry.co.uk/exploring/mountain-walks/ascent-of-snowdon/attachment/dsci0009-11/\" class=\"wp-image-1770\"/></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"https://leeperry.micro.blog/uploads/2023/b5adaa11fa.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"1771\" data-link=\"https://lee-perry.co.uk/exploring/mountain-walks/ascent-of-snowdon/attachment/dsci0010-6/\" class=\"wp-image-1771\"/></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"https://leeperry.micro.blog/uploads/2023/c4614ef3f2.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"1772\" data-link=\"https://lee-perry.co.uk/exploring/mountain-walks/ascent-of-snowdon/attachment/dsci0011-10/\" class=\"wp-image-1772\"/></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"https://leeperry.micro.blog/uploads/2023/bf24e65d6a.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"1773\" data-link=\"https://lee-perry.co.uk/exploring/mountain-walks/ascent-of-snowdon/attachment/dsci0012-10/\" class=\"wp-image-1773\"/></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"https://leeperry.micro.blog/uploads/2023/f3e2b9aa64.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"1774\" data-link=\"https://lee-perry.co.uk/exploring/mountain-walks/ascent-of-snowdon/attachment/dsci0013-8/\" class=\"wp-image-1774\"/></figure></li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:gallery -->\n",

				"content_text": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I arrived at Llanddeusant youth hostel with Keith and Steve at about 4 O'Clock on the Friday afternoon. Weather looked promising, and we had fantastic views to Pen y Fan on route, and to Bannau Sir Gaer on arrival. Aware that no others would arrive until probably around 9pm we settled in, and went to the Cross in at about 17:30 for food. Had a good few pints and a steak, and returned to the hostel around 9pm. Llanddeusant Youth Hostel.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>To my relief the weather looked exceptionally good on the Saturday morning. To my dismay, Bannau Sir Gaer was well and truly in the clouds. I had taken the decision to wear my new winter boots in a conscious attempt to accustom myself to walking on the hills in them. All told they performed very well. I did gain a couple of blisters from them, though nothing major. They are much heavier than my other boots though, and I did gain a thigh strain, but again, now't major.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The route left the youth hostel, following a country road for a mile or so before taking to the hillside. There was no part of this route that I would describe as steep. It is though a very muddy route, and I came to regret not wearing gaitors. The route winds along the ridge of Bannau Sir Gaer above the two lakes of Llyn y Fan - Fach and Fawr. I would like to say that both lakes are fantastic. As I at no point could see either of them, I can't, not that I'm bitter!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We ascended the ridge to the top of Waun Lefrith, 677m, up then to Picws Du at 749m. We paused briefly here for a bite to eat before proceeding upwards. It did get quite cold as the wind picked up, and the drizzle became heavier. We ascended to the 781m cairn at Fan Foel, from where we would later descend, and up to the highest point of the ridge - the 802m top of Fan Brycheiniog. Most of us proceeded then on the the 761m top of Fan Hir. There is no cairn on this part of the ridge, and it was only when we had descended a little and checked the GPS that we knew we had topped out.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We reascended the 'steep' bit that we had descended, but as it was stepped the reascent was very easy compared to going down. We gathered those that we had left in the summit shelter of Fan Brycheiniog before descending to Fan Foel, and slowly descending to the youth hostel. Only at the very end did we come out of the clouds. The photos taken are poor, and there are few of them as the camera was playing up.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I found the descent quite difficult with the thigh strain, though I couldn't really say it was painfull at any point. I quite enjoyed another steak in the Cross Inn, and a few more pints. I asked for medium rare, and whilst it had been exceptionally good the evening before, if this one had been any rarer it would have been running around my plate! For some reason I was asleep for 9:30, and slept for about 12 hours. Really enjoyed the walk though, despite the weather.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:gallery {\"ids\":[1750,1751,1752,1753,1754,1755,1756,1757,1758,1759],\"columns\":5} -->\n<ul class=\"wp-block-gallery columns-5 is-cropped\"><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"https://leeperry.micro.blog/uploads/2023/bc06994870.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"1750\" data-link=\"https://lee-perry.co.uk/exploring/mountain-walks/traverse-of-bannau-sir-gaer/attachment/dsci0001-12/\" class=\"wp-image-1750\"/></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"https://leeperry.micro.blog/uploads/2023/be29c01240.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"1751\" data-link=\"https://lee-perry.co.uk/exploring/mountain-walks/traverse-of-bannau-sir-gaer/attachment/dsci0002-12/\" class=\"wp-image-1751\"/></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"https://leeperry.micro.blog/uploads/2023/1768c59e75.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"1752\" data-link=\"https://lee-perry.co.uk/exploring/mountain-walks/traverse-of-bannau-sir-gaer/attachment/dsci0003-12/\" class=\"wp-image-1752\"/></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"https://leeperry.micro.blog/uploads/2023/f94d1070c2.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"1753\" data-link=\"https://lee-perry.co.uk/exploring/mountain-walks/traverse-of-bannau-sir-gaer/attachment/dsci0001-13/\" class=\"wp-image-1753\"/></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"https://leeperry.micro.blog/uploads/2023/3b4425d407.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"1754\" data-link=\"https://lee-perry.co.uk/exploring/mountain-walks/traverse-of-bannau-sir-gaer/attachment/dsci0002-13/\" class=\"wp-image-1754\"/></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"https://leeperry.micro.blog/uploads/2023/c1797524b4.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"1755\" data-link=\"https://lee-perry.co.uk/exploring/mountain-walks/traverse-of-bannau-sir-gaer/attachment/dsci0003-13/\" class=\"wp-image-1755\"/></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"https://leeperry.micro.blog/uploads/2023/b8c00c4c39.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"1756\" data-link=\"https://lee-perry.co.uk/exploring/mountain-walks/traverse-of-bannau-sir-gaer/attachment/dsci0004-12/\" class=\"wp-image-1756\"/></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"https://leeperry.micro.blog/uploads/2023/8ba1a0830d.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"1757\" data-link=\"https://lee-perry.co.uk/exploring/mountain-walks/traverse-of-bannau-sir-gaer/attachment/dsci0005-11/\" class=\"wp-image-1757\"/></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"https://leeperry.micro.blog/uploads/2023/f37f3bcef4.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"1758\" data-link=\"https://lee-perry.co.uk/exploring/mountain-walks/traverse-of-bannau-sir-gaer/attachment/dsci0006-12/\" class=\"wp-image-1758\"/></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"https://leeperry.micro.blog/uploads/2023/d23f5ebf02.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"1759\" data-link=\"https://lee-perry.co.uk/exploring/mountain-walks/traverse-of-bannau-sir-gaer/attachment/dsci0007-9/\" class=\"wp-image-1759\"/></figure></li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:gallery -->\n",

				"content_text": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I hadn't been looking forward to today for some reason, in fact I had contemplated not actually going. I suppose it was in part due to the fact that I had not at all enjoyed my trip to the Moelwyn's four weeks earlier, I was still carrying the virus that had hindered me on that trip, and I simply was not feeling as fit as I had been in July and August.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Although the day would prove that my fitness level had dropped, I had a pretty awesome day, putting in the longest route since I wild camped on<a href=\"https://exploringwildplaces.co.uk/blog/wasdale31072004/index.html\">Styhead Tarn</a>. I walked with Steve and Neil today, we jumped off the coach at Torver to get an extra half hour on the hill, and we certainly made the most of it. We followed a bridleway up from Torver up to a bridge by some old quarries, where we crossed the Beck.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We took a few moments after the bridge getting our bearings, ensuring we did not head straight to Coniston. Steve contemplated walking up some old slag heap that I really did not fancy being buried underneath. To be fair it was probably more stable than some of the crap we walked over on the Moelwyns. We proceeded to walk up alongside Torver Beck, until we came to the site of an old quarry, which had a fantastic little lake inside it, and a waterfall where the Beck ran in to it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We followed the Beck up to the Walna Scar Road, where again we paused to find our bearings. In particular we were looking for the track that cut the corner up to the top of the Beck at Goat's Water, and in particular, the bog. When we got up to Goat's Water we sat and ate lunch for about ten minutes. Neil was surveying a scramble on Dow Crag that he went off to play with. The wind picked up pretty quickly, and I felt cold at this point. The early morning sun had now dissipated, and the cloud was hovering over us somewhat ominously. A family pulled up next to us and disappeared in to a poncho, leaving me quite jealous at this point.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Neil set off to play on Dow Crag, with the intention of catching up with Myself and Steve later on our route. I was quite pleased when Steve informed me that the pull up to Goat's Hawse was the steepest climb of the day, as it looked far from formidable, especially with its dreaded zig zags! We were on the Hawse in about 10 minutes, and the rest of the day proved to be a very pleasant ridge walk very similar to the one that I enjoyed so much on the Carneddau.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We climbed the final 150m up to the top of Coniston Old Man at 803m, it was a doddle really, just following the ridge along. It was as busy a mountain as I have been on this year, a real pain to find somewhere quiet to water the grass. The weather was as bad at this point as it was all day. We were just momentarily in the cloud, and the wind and rain picked up. We bumped in to a couple of other club members up there, but paused only momentarily before retracing our steps north along the ridge. We had a very pleasant walk over to Brim Fell at 796m, the clouds had lifted somewhat, and the rain had become lighter. The view to Coniston once more became apparent, as the photographs show.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We descended at this point to Levers Hawse before reascending up Swirl Band past Little How Crags to Great How Crags. I had to fight my way past some dudes on the cairn eating there lunch so that I could touch the top! We persisted along Swirl Band to Swirl How at 802m, where we found females on the summit cairn, made a nice change. We descended down the Prison Band to Swirl Hawse. We had just reached the bottom when Neil caught up with us. We sat and paused for a bite to eat once more, this was at about 14:30, we had started at 10:45. Neil and Steve had a conversation with some more females that we had discovered, and I immediately developed the hic-cups, which incidentally I still had up to 21:00, much to the amusement of anyone within about 20 metres of me.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Being stood halfway up Wetherlam there really was little question that I would go up it, but it was much to Steve's bemusement that he had spent most of the day persuading me to take on an extra top, the worm had turned! The ascent up to the top of Wetherlam at 762m is very gentle from this direction, and I very much enjoyed it apart from the hic-cups. I did regret not going on to tick Black Sails, but it will still be there long after I've gone. We turned South and followed the ridge along in the general direction of Coniston, before rejoining the path, and descending in the direction of Hole Rake. We avoided the bog, well Steve and Neil did, my boots tell a different story!, and joined a good track.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It was now about 16:00, we instantly increased pace, sensing a pint of Bluebird bitter was very close. I uncharacteristically paused only momentarily to take a picture of the spectacular, though gruesome, quarries on the East face of the Old Man. We were sat in the Sun by 16:00 drinking a pint, having returned earlier than most of our colleagues. With the coach being half empty we had a double seat each, I slept all the way down the M6, pausing sleep occasionally only to hic-cup. I feel very sore a day later, but I thoroughly enjoyed the walk, and hope for more like that in the future.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:gallery

It took us about half an hour just to find the summit cairn - and that was with the help of a GPS and countless nuttalls books. I did enjoy the walk, but didn't feel particularly well, and struggled more than normal with the ascent. I also got absolutely drenched, and sat on the coach home with saturated boxer shorts. I should have gone commando really! There are tons of pictures of Andy, as he winged that there was only one of the top of his sack on Blencathra.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The route went from Tanygrisiau, and along the track to the power station on the shore of the reservoir. We couldn't get any further along the path, so we cut up alongside a stream and headed up to Llyn Stwlan, which interestingly enough sounds like a Nazi concentration camp. We took Moelwyn Back from the East, we dropped down on a path to the col between the two Moelwyns (north), and descended once more to Llyn Stwlan. This time we walked along the dam, dropping down on to a tarmac track which we followed back to the village.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:gallery {\"ids\":[1700,1701,1702,1703,1704,1705,1706,1707,1708,1709,1710,1711],\"columns\":6} -->\n<ul class=\"wp-block-gallery columns-6 is-cropped\"><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"https://leeperry.micro.blog/uploads/2023/184e82891f.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"1700\" data-link=\"https://lee-perry.co.uk/exploring/mountain-walks/ascent-of-moelwyn-bach/attachment/dsci0001-10/\" class=\"wp-image-1700\"/></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"https://leeperry.micro.blog/uploads/2023/f59359123c.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"1701\" data-link=\"https://lee-perry.co.uk/exploring/mountain-walks/ascent-of-moelwyn-bach/attachment/dsci0002-10/\" class=\"wp-image-1701\"/></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"https://leeperry.micro.blog/uploads/2023/9bcd69a2f1.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"1702\" data-link=\"https://lee-perry.co.uk/exploring/mountain-walks/ascent-of-moelwyn-bach/attachment/dsci0003-10/\" class=\"wp-image-1702\"/></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"https://leeperry.micro.blog/uploads/2023/64ed4956a1.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"1703\" data-link=\"https://lee-perry.co.uk/exploring/mountain-walks/ascent-of-moelwyn-bach/attachment/dsci0004-10/\" class=\"wp-image-1703\"/></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"https://leeperry.micro.blog/uploads/2023/8afa05061f.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"1704\" data-link=\"https://lee-perry.co.uk/exploring/mountain-walks/ascent-of-moelwyn-bach/attachment/dsci0007-8/\" class=\"wp-image-1704\"/></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"https://leeperry.micro.blog/uploads/2023/dab9b34708.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"1705\" data-link=\"https://lee-perry.co.uk/exploring/mountain-walks/ascent-of-moelwyn-bach/attachment/dsci0009-9/\" class=\"wp-image-1705\"/></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"https://leeperry.micro.blog/uploads/2023/decd428c43.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"1706\" data-link=\"https://lee-perry.co.uk/exploring/mountain-walks/ascent-of-moelwyn-bach/attachment/dsci0011-8/\" class=\"wp-image-1706\"/></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"https://leeperry.micro.blog/uploads/2023/e5874a865e.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"1707\" data-link=\"https://lee-perry.co.uk/exploring/mountain-walks/ascent-of-moelwyn-bach/attachment/dsci0012-8/\" class=\"wp-image-1707\"/></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"https://leeperry.micro.blog/uploads/2023/b74f1cfc0e.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"1708\" data-link=\"https://lee-perry.co.uk/exploring/mountain-walks/ascent-of-moelwyn-bach/attachment/dsci0013-7/\" class=\"wp-image-1708\"/></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"https://leeperry.micro.blog/uploads/2023/9615d47775.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"1709\" data-link=\"https://lee-perry.co.uk/exploring/mountain-walks/ascent-of-moelwyn-bach/attachment/dsci0014-8/\" class=\"wp-image-1709\"/></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"https://leeperry.micro.blog/uploads/2023/b66a9a6351.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"1710\" data-link=\"https://lee-perry.co.uk/exploring/mountain-walks/ascent-of-moelwyn-bach/attachment/dsci0015-7/\" class=\"wp-image-1710\"/></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"https://leeperry.micro.blog/uploads/2023/3eecf45fd2.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"1711\" data-link=\"https://lee-perry.co.uk/exploring/mountain-walks/ascent-of-moelwyn-bach/attachment/dsci0016-6/\" class=\"wp-image-1711\"/></figure></li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:gallery -->\n",

				"content_text": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Today was pretty awesome, I kind of knew that it would be trying to sleep last night, with pictures of Sharp Edge running through my mind. Having not done a graded scramble beforehand I was somewhat nervous about going for it. The weather was fantastic all the way up North on the coach, and I knew it would be on, and that Skiddaw could wait.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We left the coach at a layby by Scales, and promptly followed a nicely winding track around Scales Fell, along Scales Beck and up to Scales Tarn. I thought that the view of Sharp Edge as you turned the corner was fairly impressive. It didn't reach Aonach Egach proportions though.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It was about this point where the gods began to conspire against us, promptly signalled by the sight of Andy Brown in his thong about to go for a swim in Scales Tarn. We sat and watched for about half an hour, before setting off for our assault on the ridge.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As we arrived at the start of the ridge, as if by divine intervention, the wind picked up. We had barely noticed it all morning, but by the start of the ridge a small gale was howling. Some of our group diverted around the side of the ridge but there was no escaping the scramble at its end, so me and Andy Snape promptly climbed back on the ridge and continued the scramble.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The only thing that I didn't like about Sharp Edge was the fact that in all it took about 20 minutes, apart from waiting for people ahead to move on. I would say though that I did not find it excessively technical, and would probably say that I have scrambled harder on previous walks, particularly on the Rhinogs in places. It did really kick off my appetite for more though. I was pleased with the way that I coped with it as well, I didn't notice the exposure while I was scrambling, only afterwards looking back.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>On completing the scramble myself and Paul diverted from the track to tick off Atkinson Pike at 845m. We then descended and ascended along a broad ridge, with several memorial crosses, to the summit of Blencathra at 868m. We sat around for over half an hour having lunch before ticking off Gategill Fell Top at 851m, and descending over Knowe Crags at 804m. To my regret I raced off with Keith to Keswick pulling in a good half an hour before the rest of the group, and missed out on ticking off Latrigg, 368m, with Paul.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The only thing that I would say about this route is that it is really a half day route. I was in Keswick by 4pm. In a smaller group it could have been a couple of hours earlier, and then Skiddaw too might have been feasible!!!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:gallery

Therefore your'e now getting the simplified version. I had a crap drive up to Wasdale Head on Friday. I didn't arrive until 23:15, and the bar was shut. We sat arount the Barbie until about 2am, before getting to bed. I slept in Billy's tent as there was no room to pitch mine on the site.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>On the Saturday we got up at about 9am, and set off up Moses Trod to Styhead Tarn at about 11am. Me and Graham arrived there first, pitching the tents before the others arrived. In the process of which my inner nearly blew in to the lake. At about 13:00 Andy, Darren and Graham went of to climb on Napes Needle. After much deliberation me and Billy opted for Glaramara, basically because there was a pub at the end of it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We really did have an excellent walk in with views over Langdale, of Bow-fell, and of Great End and Esk Pike. We quickly ascended Allen Craggs, 785m, and took in the the views over Derwent Water to Skiddaw. From here though it seemed to take forever to reach the top of Glaramara at 783m. It took us until 16:00 to get there. We should have turned back here but the lure of the Helvellyn Gold was too strong. We lost the track momentarily on the way down, before finding it again on Thornythwaite Fell.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The descent seemed to take disproportionately long, and we did not arrive at the pub until about 17:30. We returned via Grains Gill, not arriving back until 21:00. When we got back we couldn't even be bothered to cook, we just crashed.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:gallery

Although the Malverns are desolate by no stretch of the imagination, at least there wasn't a tarmac road up to the top. We set of from British Camp at about 19:30 having paid the extortionate fee of ¬£2 to park there. We ascended fairly steeply to start with on a grass track up to British Camp Reservoir, and on to the hillside above. Here we paused for breath and took in the awesome views over the reservoir.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We didn't stay for long, we took in Hangman's Hill at 276m, and pushed for time on to Swinyard Hill at 245m. We returned to the col between these two hills where the group split in to two. Half of us raced over Millenium Hill at 327m and the Herefordshire Beacon at 338m, and caught up with the other half of the group who had descended directly to British Camp. We managed to reach the Malvern Hills Hotel for 20:30 as prearranged. As it turned out the food didn't arrive for another hour, so we could have got in Midsummer Hill also at 286m.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As far as i'm aware I didnt tick off any tops on the lists today, but i'd rather be in the Malverns than the loftier Clees or the Wrekin any day of the week.

It was on a Saturday as they had decided to have an extended coach meet with a social at the end. Therefore we did not have to worry about time so much in the afternoon. We arrived on the shore of Llyn Ogwen at about 10:30, with fairly clear weather, but a cloud cover of about 800m was apparent. After enjoying the spectacular views of Tryfan, The Glyders and Y Garn we started up alongside Afon Lloer towards Clogwyn Mawr. We ascended a short scramble to the left of the cwm and headed off on to Pen yr Ole Wen at 978m.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Having suffered from a virus for two weeks I struggled considerably on the ascent of Pen yr Ole Wen, not helped by the fact that I was carrying 4 Litres of water! Immediately after leaving the summit I began to feel much better, and didn't struggle again at any point during the day. We ascended in to the clouds on the summit of Pen yr Ole Wen, and didn't come out of them until about 4 hours later. Although at times the wind was cold, the rain was never heavy, and the conditions never posed too much of a problem.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After Pen yr Ole Wen we proceeded in a North Easterly direction over Carnedd Fach, and slowly but surely on to the summit of Carnedd Dafydd at 1044m. Deep in to the cloud by now, we paused only for a brief moment to regroup before heading off over the Carneddau for Carnedd Llewelyn. We did descend briefly out of the cloud on this stretch, just long enough for me to take a photograph of Ffynnon Llugwy reservoir below, before once more the cloud closed in.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The ascent on to Carnedd Llewelyn too was a long and gentle one, being at no point difficult or serious, only in the final ascent being steep in places. It was very cold on top here, and the group stopped for lunch in the windbreaks on the summit at 1064m. I was very cold at this point, and struggled to find any respite from the weather. I was relieved that we stopped for probably only about 10 minutes before heading off. I did though spend the next half hour with my hands in my pockets to warm them.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Off the Carneddau we proceeded North East to Foel Grach at 976m. It had a very well built summit shelter, which could be used in need in the future. Although apparently there is a very good path at this point, we could not find it, and pushed on through the heather until we reached the outcrop above the shelter.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We pushed on North to Garnedd Uchaf, at 976m, barely noticing any uphill momentum prior to hitting the summit cairn. Immediately we continued North to Foel-fras at 942m. As I approached Mike he said that I could go climb up the rocks to the trig point if I wanted. I certainly wasn't coming back in a few years time just to tick this off, so on I clambered, and everyone then seemed to follow. We the descended steeply to a bealach which finally brought us out of the cloud</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>From the bealach I ran up to the summit shelter of Drum at 770m, clambering over the stile, and taking in the views before anybody else arrived. We then sat around in the shelter for a good 20 minutes before moving on. This was supposed to be our last top of the day, but I was feeling a little too energetic to call healthy!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Having been unable to convince anybody else to climb anything further I trundled off desolately with the group, before spotting Carnedd y Ddelw at 688m. It had little reascent, and it was not at all steep, so I took a detour to it on my own, stood on top, and rejoined the path about 300m ahead of the group. Mike decided that we could take a few more tops with it being an extended meet, probably because he would have had to have looked at me sulking for the next four hours if he had disagreed.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Having diverted on to the summit of Pen Bryn-Du at 557m we proceeded to ascend steeply on to Yr Orsedd at 559m, descended about 60 metres to a bealach, and then ascended to the top of Foel-ganol at 536m. At this point the group was heading down, so I ran up Foel Dduarth, 529m, before descending quickly to rejoin the group. At this point I was extremely pleased that I had carried extra water, drinking my extra two litres on the walk to the Aber Falls Tavern. The food was great, and the company also. Looking forward to a couple of weeks rest now though.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:gallery

				"content_text": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I don't know whether it was bravado or ambition, I would like to think that it was the latter, but it was probably the former, when on the Saturday evening myself and Anthony decided that we would ascend Snowdon and return before our respective rides left at 1200. We rose at 0515, and had left Plas Gwynant by half past. Nev had assured me that we would be back for breakfast at 0830. I was a little more sceptical, predicting a finish at around 1000.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It wasn't long before I was regretting going at all, I had my usual slow start, but my legs were very heavy from the exertions of the previous day, and I was carrying virtually all of the equipment that I had taken with me on the Friday, as we had to empty the rooms by 1030. Concurrently I could feel my throat burning and was struggling for air. I suddenly remembered that I was actually ill.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Strangely I began to feel better once we began the steep ascent after the old slate piles. We seemed to find the top of the ridge very quickly, and we were making very good time. By now we were in the clouds, but the rain was not too heavy, and we weren't too cold. We carried on untill we came to a section with about ten paths to choose from, all covered in scree. The weather was closing in, and we could not find an obvious route. We decided to turn back.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Only on our return to Plas Gwynant were we to be told that any one of those tracks would have taken us up on to the summit. We knew that we had been very close, although we still had over 100m of ascent left, it would have taken at most 30 minutes more from where we had turned around. Once we turned around though, we noticed how much the weather had changed in the cloud. The path that we had been on half an hour earlier was by now completely water logged, but we quickly descended out of the cloud, and enjoyed a nice walk back in the sunshine, passing a ridiculous amount of people - we didn't see a soul until about 0900, and were duly back at Plas Gwynant for 1000.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>With retrospect it would have been nice to have attained the summit, but we had a good climb, we didn't get lost, were still here, and Snowdon will still be there next time i'm in the neighborhood - and next time I'm ascending via Yr Aran and the South ridge, have a look of the photographs I have taken of that route, it looks fantastic.<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:gallery

So with some surprise I can say that this was an excellent walk - so go do it. However, Steve, its not Buachaille Etive Mor!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We didn't spend much time in the clouds today, which was a blessing as Snowdon spent the day in a big dirty one. We left Plas Gwynant at about 0930 heading down to Beddgelert in the cars. After what seemed like an eternity waiting for everybody to get ready we probably left Beddgelert at about 1000, setting off through the village towards the track up Moel Hebog.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We sped off up the track through a farmyard, through a gate, and out in to the open countryside, and on to the side of Moel Hebog. I found it quite difficult to start with, as I always seem to, but more so than normal today. I soon found my rhythm though. Ultimately the group was too big to stay together, and it split in to two. I chose to stay with the slower of the two groups primarily because I knew more people in it, and I hadn't been feeling great.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We continued slowly, regrouping at regular intervals. Before long we came to the outcrops just below the summit. Somehow we ended up on a ledge with an active scree slope above it. Ollie stood on it, and as I was holding on to the rock in the faintest of holds I wasn't best pleased when he told me the scree were moving.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I managed to slowly move far enough to his left to allow him to get off the scree he was standing on, and it all flew right past my shoulder. Unfortunately the largest rock of the lot hit Sara on the leg, and gave her a bruise a bit like mine from Glencoe. At this point I was still holding on to the same holds, and couldn't seem to find a big enough hold to maneuver down! I somehow moved further to the left and found a hold to pulled myself up on to the ledge above, and descended from there.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We found a better path to the left of where we had been climbing and followed that more purposefully until it brought us out on to the summit plateau of Moel Hebog, which we walked up to the trig point at 782m. We caught up with the faster group at this point, who were set around in a poncho. They left just after we arrived, and we sat in the shelter of the farmer's wall and had our lunch, while being pestered somewhat by a rather evil looking sheep.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We descended steeply to the bealach between Moel Hebog and Moel yr Ogof, and feeling much better now I sped down with John, arriving at the bottom a full 10 minutes or so before our colleagues. We ascended through a gap between two large rock walls, descending again to a rather large looking pool. Deceptively at first there appeared to be no obvious route through it, but this was solved by climbing a large boulder to the one side of it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We stopped only briefly at the summit of Moel yr Ogof at 655m to take a few photographs. The descent to the bealach between her and Moel Lefn was somewhat less steep, and there was little reascent thereafter. Sara found a large ledge on the North side of the summit rocks that had no wind and pure sunshine. We probably sat here for about half an hour, having a bite to eat, and a rest. Again as we arrived here we could see our other party about 100 metres in front of us. I felt so much better that I actually ran up the last of the ascent to the summit at 638m.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We slowly worked our way down, and found the path that was to take us through Beddgelert Forest and back to Beddgelert. This path was quite boggy but I managed to avoid soaking my boots through for once. It was more important than usual for me, as I was toying with the idea of pushing for a very early summit of Snowdon the next day. Eventually we came out of the forest, and followed a long track that met up with the ascent track we had utilised earlier in the day. We passed once more through the farm, and on to the hotel in Beddgelert for a well earned pint of Guiness.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:gallery

Had a very good climb, we followed a track from Seatoller to Seathwaite, and picked up a track there alongside Sourmilk Gill. We followed that around Base Brown and up on to Green Gabled, where we had lunch inside the windbreak. As always I managed to spend my day in a cloud, it was probably the only cloud in the whole of the North of England it was that nice a day!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We set off after lunch and followed the path up onto the summit of Great Gable, where we lost the path somewhat, and ended up hitting the path out about a Kilometre further away from home than the path, and had to endure the horrors of the Tarr Step. We followed the track alongside Styhead Gill past Styhead Tarn to Stockley Bridge, and onto Seathwaite where we picked up the path back to Seatoller.

I escaped midge infested Kinlochleven at about 1100 and went for breakfast at Crafts and Things again. I walked the 2 miles down to the SNT visitor centre and bought everbodies presents. Then I walked back up to Glencoe, had a wander around to the MacDonald memorial before heading down to the Lochans. I walked around each of the three Lochan trals, probably about 6 miles altogether, before arriving back in Glencoe at about 1700. I went for another pot of tea in Crafts and Things, walked back into Glencoe to the Spa for some food for the journey home, and then hung around Loch Leven until the coach picked me up at 2000. Felt pretty fit for the first time since arrival today.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:gallery

Went for breakfast at Crafts and Things (again!) and then set off down the main road in the direction of the Scottish National Trust visitor centre. Went in and wandered around&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.michael-macgregor.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Michael Macgregor's</a>photographic exhibition, which was pretty bloody excellent, before setting off into the abyss.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I set off towards Aonach Dubh 'a Ghlinne, and had a good look at its West bank, but decided that Cameron McNeish's route looked a bit too steep for the wreck that I felt like. I decided to climb Sgor na h-Ulaidh from the end of the landrover track instead. Then I went as far as the base of Am Bodach, gaining a good look at the Three Sisters in the process.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I actually managed to drink a couple of litres of the water, so felt hydrated for the first time since leaving Birmingham. I also discovered that wearing an inner pair of socks prevents creating all the blisters I had got in the first couple of days - as I rarely blister. Suffered with a tight left achilles tendon most of the day though.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Having checked out the weather forecast at the visitor centre, I decided to attempt Sgor na h-Ulaidh on Friday, Bidean nam Bian on Sunday, possibly put in a third climb on the Tuesday. Had dinner in the Clachaig again - really couldn't be bothered to cook! Didn't get as much trouble of the midges today, and got a little suntan.

The torrential rain from the previous evening persisted until about 11 o'clock, which was better than the forecast. After briefly contemplating climbing I left for Glencoe at about 1130.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I went to Crafts and Things again and had a pot of tea, and an absolutely awesome bacon and egg roll. Another torrential outburst put finished any slight possibility of my climbing today. I decided to walk along Loch Leven instead to Kinlochleven.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I set off in quite heavy rain, which dissipated after about half an hour. Not really much to tell. The views were fantastic, and I had a look at the Ice Factor. I also had a wander around the Aluminium Story exhibition. I bought some supplies in the Co-op, watched the bus go past, and set off on the long road back.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I had got about half way, as far as about Torr Phloda, when two very nice blokes on their way to Fort William decided to pick me up, and drop me off in Glencoe. That was without my even thumbing for a lift.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I had a shower and cooked dinner, but unfortunately I had a slight disagreement with the Highland Midge, and scampered off to the Clachaig for food, and only just in time.

I walked about a mile towards Kinlochleven before turning back to the village. Check out the photos over the loch on arrival. By the time I had pitched the tent and had lunch it was about 1230, and I decided that it was too late to entertain a climb that day.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I decided that I was going to walk up through North Ballachulish up to the Corran Ferry. I walked up to Glencoe, where I found a little tea shop at Tigh-Phuirt overlooking Loch Leven, called Crafts and Things, where I stopped and drank a pot of tea in the sunshine.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I wandered up to Ballachulish and spent a couple of hours walking around the old slate quarries, and around the village itself. I spotted a chip shop that I decided to have dinner at that evening.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I followed the road along Loch Leven to South Ballachulish, but by now it was beginning to get quite late. I stopped briefly to examine the statue to James Stewart, who was allegedly hung wrongly for the Appin murders. I limped over the bridge on my blisters to North Ballachulish, and had a quick look at the chocolate factory there, and also at Beinn a Beithir.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I dragged myself back to the campsite, with heavily blistered feet, which I found strange. This was confounded by the disappearance of the chip shop in Ballachulish which I have still not refound. Got a take away at Viva's in Glencoe, it was foul! Just as I got back in to the tent a downpour of Swansea proportions started, and persisted throughout the evening.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:gallery

I found all the rocks around the summit an aggravation, but at least they weren&rsquo;t covered in lichen like those on Cadair. We sat on the summit of 902m for only a few moments staring at the Sca Fell range hidden in the clouds.

I was hoping for a McDonalds, but it was just wishful thinking. We probably hung around too long in the hut, and I was absolutely freezing immediately after leaving.
