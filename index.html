			 <p>Easily the worst that I have seen Burnley play this season.  We contained Manchester City well for the first 15 minutes until Alvarez put city ahead.  Alvarez extended the lead from a quickly taken free kick while Burnley switched off later in the first half, and Rodri wrapped up the goals for City from the restart after half time.  Ameen Al Dakhil provided a consolation in injury time.</p>
<p>Despite the nature of two of the goals, the score is flattering. We looked off the pace, second to every ball, unable to keep the ball.  The first 60-70 minutes were dreadful. The second half began to feel like a friendly.  Until the substitutions.</p>
<p>The introduction of Anas Zaroury prompted 7 minutes of the Anas Zaroury song. Non-stop.  After an interlude for the Manuel Benson song we returned to it!  Wilson Obobert has been one of the high points of the winter, but was anonymous here, with Zaroury introducing much more threat down the left wing.</p>
<p>Connor Roberts brought some fight to the performance. Literally. How Ederson was not sent off for dragging him across the pitch in a headlock, I’ve no idea. VAR, fucking pointless.</p>
<p>Fofana. Considering that he is self professed to be lazy and not like running, he ran with strength and power, but with finesse and ball control. Much more weight and fight up front. I’d hoped Obafemi might provide this, but he has gone out to Milwall on loan.  He lined up the cross which resulted in the Burnley goal.</p>
<p>A final mention for Han Noah Massenho, who was given around 10 minutes for his premier league debut, and looked competent and not out of place.</p>
<p>I hope that we learn from that final spell, and bring the same fight and spirit to the remainder of the season.</p>

			 <p>The Etihad Stadium in Manchester is the home of Manchester City FC.  Originally built as an athletics stadium for the Commonwealth Games held in the city in 2002, the stadium was extended in 2014 to a capacity of 53,400, and is due to be expanded again to 60,000 over the next few years.</p>
<p>I have visited the stadium before, prior to the expansion, for a Foo Fighters gig in the early 2010s.</p>
<p>The match program is £4, par in the Premier League.</p>
<p>The catering was pretty good really. £11.50 bought me a huge Southern Fried Chicken and BBQ sauce wrap, a packet of crisps and a bovril. Slightly cheaper than the London clubs, but definitely not competing with the wonder that is the Wham Stadium.</p>
<p>Probably the most impressive bowl stadium that I’ve visited, it really is like sitting in a theatre.  The atmosphere is dreadful though and City have really overplayed the choreography.  Reminding their fans of each of their songs about their team prior to kick off. It’s a really impressive structure, for a library.</p>

			 <p>My solution to the &lsquo;Use control flow and loops to solve a problem&rsquo; to the Programming in Python module within the Meta Back-End Developer Professional Certificate in Coursera.</p>
<p>It uses a for loop to iterate through <code>num_list</code>, and and if-else block to test whether the value is over 45 or not, f-string literal to present the output, and addition assignment to count iterations of the loop.  Finally a break statement is inserted at the end of the if-statement, terminating the output and count at the end of the &lsquo;over-45&rsquo; that I&rsquo;m so close to joining.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code># Inside the for loop, create a condition that will look for all numbers that are greater than 45 and print out only numbers that meet that condition
# Change the print statement to “Over 45” and add an else condition with a print statement of “Under 45”.
# Update the for loop to use the enumerate function so you can get and use the index. Alter the condition to look for number 36 and print out the following: ‘Number found at position: ‘, index number
# Next, create a new variable called count and assign it a value of 0 and place it outside the for loop.
# Inside the for loop increment the counter by 1.
# Add a print statement outside the for loop to print the value of the count variable.
# Finally, add a break statement directly after the print statement inside the if condition for finding the number.

num_list = [33,42,5,66,77,22,16,79,36,62,78,43,88,39,53,67,89,11]
count = 0

for idx, item in enumerate(num_list):
    if item &gt; 45:
        print(f&#34;Over 45 at position {idx}:&#34;, item)
        break
    else:
        print(f&#34;Under 45 at position {idx}:&#34;, item)
    count += 1

print(f&#34;Items counted: {count}&#34;)

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>In this post I describe the match case statement in Python, and how to use it.</p>
<p>I try to spend 30 minutes to an hour each day on learning to code, usually working my way through the Meta frontend and backend courses in Coursera.  Then I practice what I&rsquo;ve learned, and write about it here to crystallise the learning.  December went pretty well, January didn&rsquo;t really got going, till today.</p>
<p>In python and other programming languages it is really easy to find yourself writing increasingly convoluted if / elif / else blocks dealing with all the permutations of what you are trying to achieve.  Match case deals with that by simplifying the arguments that you write and the amount of code needed to write them.</p>
<p>Before getting going though, it is worth point out that this functionality was introduced to Python in 3.10 - so you are not going to see it in legacy code, and you may need to upgrade your interpreter if the installed version is more than a couple of years old.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the match statement you identify the value that you wish to test, in the example below I will be testing against the variable <code>your_club.lower()</code>.  This saves declaring the variable in each test, as I would need to do in writing an if / elif / else block.</p>
<p>Having identified the value to test against in the match statement, the corresponding case statements identify what should happen if that value matches.  Statements are simplified further by the and/or operators <code>&amp;</code> and <code>|</code> which provide for additional conditionality in a very straightforward way.  For example, in the code below if <code>your_club.lower()</code> is either &ldquo;blackburn&rsquo; or &lsquo;blackburn rovers&rsquo; the value &lsquo;Deadwood&rsquo; will be returned.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>your_club = input(&#34;Please enter the name of the team you support: &#34;)
statement = your_club + &#34; play at: &#34;
match your_club.lower():
    case &#34;accrington&#34;:
        print(statement + &#34;the Wham Stadium&#34;)
    case &#34;blackburn&#34; | &#34;blackburn rovers:
        print(statement + &#34;Deadwood&#34;)
    case &#34;burnley&#34;:
        print(statement + &#34;Turf Moor&#34;)
    case _:
        print(&#34;Sorry, &#34; + your_club + &#34; is not in our database yet.&#34;)

			 <p>Burnley play Liverpool at Anfield on 10 February, and I was really disappointed on Thursday when Burnley&rsquo;s ticket allocation of 1,900 seats sold out before sales opened to my category the following morning.</p>
<p>There are almost 55,000 seats at Anfield, and an allocation of 1,900 seems particularly light - though in line with previous allocations to Burnley at Anfield.  Given the pace with which they sold out, and the accessibility of Liverpool from Burnley, I&rsquo;m sure that we would fill at least double that allocation.</p>
<p>I wanted to try to understand why the allocation was so paltry so, as a lawyer, I turned to the <a href="https://resources.premierleague.com/premierleague/document/2024/01/04/21175cfd-faa3-4b01-bbad-65894fead686/PL_Handbook_2023-24_DIGITAL_04.01.24-final-.pdf">Premier League Handbook 2023-24</a> to try to establish why this was so.  I also wanted to understand where the various quotas came from that I could find being quoted across the internet.</p>
<p>Rule R.9 (p.236) provides:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Unless otherwise agreed by the Board or between the Clubs, and subject to Rule R.11, at each League Match, the Home Club shall make available to the Visiting Club the following allocation of tickets (with such allocation to be inclusive of a minimum of 10% of the Home Club’s disabled spectator accommodation in each case):
R.9.1. 3,000 tickets; or
R.9.2. if the capacity of the Home Club’s Stadium is less than 30,000, such number of tickets as is equal to 10% of its Stadium capacity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So as a starting point Liverpool should be offering a ticket allocation of at least 3,000 tickets to Burnley.  Reading more widely, Liverpool offering allocations below 3,000 to visiting supporters seems to be a fairly common occurence <a href="https://www.themag.co.uk/2023/10/newcastle-united-fans-set-to-get-reduced-ticket-allocation-for-liverpool-match/">1</a>, <a href="https://www.awaygames.co.uk/away-day-guides/liverpool-away/">2</a>.  While the guidance to the rule provides for approval of a lower allocation only where:</p>
<ol>
<li>A reduced allocation is required to ensure that the game can go ahead at the time scheduled</li>
</ol>
<p>or</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>The club has informed the league before taking the proposal to the Safety Advisory Group, and</li>
<li>The home club has meaningfully consulted with the visiting club, and</li>
<li>A detailed process of consideration and consultation has been followed seeking to mitigate or avoid the reduction to the allocation.</li>
</ol>
<p>and crucially:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Where Board approval has been granted in accordance with this Rule, that approval will be time-limited (whether to a particular League Match or such other period as the Board deems appropriate). The Club concerned will be expected to take such remedial action during the close Season as necessary to ensure that no similar issues arise during the following Season.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As the allocation we received two years ago was the same 1,900, well below 3,000 this seems to be incompatible with that carve out - why?</p>
<p>I understand that there has been a long running expansion project at Anfield, so assume it relates to this - but I&rsquo;d have more sympathy for these reductions if half of the ground would not be full of two tone scarf wearing tourists anyway.  For balance, from what I&rsquo;ve seen so far, I&rsquo;m sure half of the away end will be full of tourists also.</p>

			 <p>I said before the game that I thought that if this game was not &lsquo;must win&rsquo;, it was definitely &lsquo;must not lose&rsquo;.  Burnley did not lose, but this will feel like another two points lost.</p>
<p>Luton started really well, bringing a good couple of saves out of James Trafford, and they would have felt aggrieved when Odobert cut back to Amdouni towards the end of the first half, who somehow managed to get the ball over the line from around 15m out.  I&rsquo;ve watched it back 5 times, I&rsquo;ve still no idea how that ball crosses the line.  Their number 7 Ogbene had been particularly impressive on the right wing all first half.</p>
<p>Burnley did a much better job of shutting Luton out in the second half, and spurned a couple of good chances to extend our lead with Foster and Vitinho not alone in drawing saves from Kaminski.</p>
<p>Around the 75th minute Kompany used his substitues to switch to a 541, effectively parking the bus.  That did not quite work against West Ham, and it did not quite work here either.</p>
<p>In the third minute of injury time Luton equalised controversially.  Carlton Morris firing home after James Trafford had been brought down by Adebayo.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m fed up of talking about referees, but Tony Harrington was dreadful today, probably <a href="https://lee-perry.co.uk/2024/01/10/accrington-stanley-bolton.html">even worse than Bobby Madley was on wednesday</a>.  I counted Foster being held back 5 times at the start of a counter-attack.  Not just wee holds mind, these could more accurately described as bear hugs.  Not one foul. When Foster was pulled down to break the counter no yellow card.  When Foster was kicked off the pitch, no foul, and we had to play with 10 men for a minute. Then the goal, Adebayo, who is not playing for ball, moves backwards into Trafford who is moving forward to collect the incoming cross.  I was amazed that the referee did not blow for the foul, even more amazed that VAR did not give it, and having watched it back I&rsquo;m even more amazed - it is cynical, and it is obstruction.  Maybe this is one of those that, when you slow it down looks innocuous - but at match speed, thats a free kick.</p>
<p>I think Luton were good for a point, and I think they would have felt disappointed to leave with nothing - but that is an appalling decision by both the referee, and the VAR.  I don&rsquo;t think any of the commentary team expected that goal to stand, and I cannot think of a single game where I&rsquo;ve seen the goalkeeper impeded in that way and the foul not be given.  It&rsquo;s another shocking decision, and if VAR cannot see that, there is no point to VAR whatsoever - it&rsquo;s clear, obvious, and the referee has missed it.</p>
<p>The BBC say that we are 4 points from safety, thats to Everton though and I think thats the wrong test. I think we are 7-9 points from the teams that we need to pass to stay up.  Our form is currently stronger than Brentford, and on a par with Crystal Palace, while Nottingham Forest have turned a corner, and I expect Everton to also pull clear.  There are 17 games left, but we have played more games than all of the teams around us - it could be 10 to 12 points by the time this round of matches is complete, and thats as many points as we&rsquo;ve collected in the first 19 games.  We should have collected many more points from the positions that we have been in during the first half of the season though, so its not impossible to envisage that we could put a run together and lift ourselves clear.</p>

			 <p>I was back at the Wham Stadium this evening following a short work trip over to Norwich, to see Stanley take on Bolton in last 16 of the Bristol Street Motors Trophy / EFL Trophy.</p>
<p>Apparently Accrington / Bolton is somewhat of a local derby.  Bolton sold out half the stadium, buying a ticket was pretty difficult, and the police presence huge. Not sure the Stanley fans got the message - the home attendance considerably below that at home to Salford in the league a few weeks ago.</p>
<p>Stanley started well, applying good pressure on the Bolton goal, but Bolton looked dangerous on the break.  Jerome pounced on an underpowered back-pass to lob the goalkeeper, putting Bolton in the lead, out came the blue flares.  Morley doubled the lead on 29 minutes from what looked to be a very weak penalty decision.</p>
<p>Henderson pulled one back for Stanley in the 37th, stealing the ball back and driving forward, before placing the ball in the bottom right corner, in front of the Bolton fans on the terrace.  Stanley had a number of chances to equalise, Nolan missing a really good opening in the 62nd minute sending the ball right back across goal, when it looked easier to put it in the net.</p>
<p>Dempsey settled the game in the 83, collecting a clearance, driving forward, and placing the ball in the same right corner of the net in front of the away terrace.  He was allowed far too much time and space, but the finish was sublime.</p>
<p>Worst performance of the night goes to the referee Bobby Madley, inconsistent and one sided throughout.  The worst of which was failing to produce a yellow card for a cynical pull back as Stanley broke clear.  Far too many misdemeanours to list here.</p>
<p>Bolton were good for their win, they looked much more incisive, though Stanley should be pleased with the statistics that show they held a decent proportion of the ball and put more shots on target than their opponents from the division above.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://lee-perry.co.uk/2024/01/03/website-theme-upgrade.html">Website theme upgrade - 1987 Theme</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://lee-perry.co.uk/2024/01/03/website-theme-upgrade.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2024-01-03 20:13:16 &#43;0000">Jan 3, 2024</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>My objective for this vacation was to build a theme from scratch for my website.  Within that there were a few functional objectives.</p>
<ul>
<li>I did not want to show the same intro text in the banner of each page, though I like it on the front page.</li>
<li>I had a loose idea that I liked line per item archive pages, on a single page.</li>
<li>I definitely wanted to have custom archive introductions, and had already come up with a way to produce that, but it used a partial template for each variant.</li>
<li>I felt that a last modified date would be a useful thing to automate given that as well as writing content this year, I want to get better at gardening and maintaining existing content too.</li>
</ul>
<p>It took me about a day to design my concept in html and css.  A claret and blue themed page which I decided to call 1987.  Originally this had a single column page structure, and two column post structure - with post meta and discussion displayed to the right.  While I liked that design, I felt that it would be complicating the responsive design in production, and might create problems that I could not solve with my limited css skills - so I reverted to a single column post-design when I came to build it.</p>
<p>Having designed the theme in html and css, I needed to work out how to theme it onto Hugo.  Attempting to do this in Micro.Blog would have caused a ridiculous number of rebuilds, and would have slowed the whole project down.  So I followed <a href="https://micro.blog/mandaris">@mandaris</a> series on how to set up a Hugo development server on a local machine for developing on, downloaded a copy of the blank theme for micro.blog from github, and put a little test content into my Hugo install to make sure it was running properly.</p>
<p>Having created a few test posts, I thought it would make sense to bulk import much more content.  When I downloaded my archive from micro.blog I could see in the yaml frontmatter that micro.blog wast tracking the lastmod property - and suddenly became very excited that I would be able to find a way to pull the last modified date directly within the template.</p>
<p>This first image shows the front page design.  The intro text is currently hard coded, though that can be pulled through directly from Micro.Blog.</p>
<p>I have written a custom index.html file, negating the need for the custom front page plugin.  To the top of the page I have written a script pulling through the 5 most recent posts.  To the bottom is my digital garden, which I had to convert from the markdown into html.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>At the bottom of the page in the footer area I originally had 4 x footer blocks running horizontally, though I ran out of ideas about what to put in them.  So I consolidated that area into a single bock. I have added a category block so that the category archives are accessible from every page in the site, and below that are links to the indieWeb and Tinylytics webrings that my site is part of.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I quite like the way that <a href="https://micro.blog/jsonbecker">@jsonbecker</a> presents the post archive in his theme, titled posts only, with a very clean archive listing.  I wanted to replace my archive page with something similar, so I have removed untitled posts from my archive page, presenting only titled articles on a line per item basis.  I have also added the categorisation to the end of each line.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I did not want to just lose short form posts in their entirety though, and they serve a different purpose to articles in my site though.  So as you can see in the image below, they are presented in their own stream of snips, or microposts, along with a preview of any images in the post.  That is populated directly from the snips category, that I have set micro.blog up to filter all of my untitled posts into by default.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The default micro.blog photos page drives me crazy.  There is nothing particularly wrong with it, I just hate galleries with whitespace caused by a mix of portrait and landscape orientation photos.  I have used the css cover and max-height properties to provide a more consistent grid.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The Today page was a real challenge, I&rsquo;ll talk about this more on a subsequent &rsquo;lessons learned&rsquo; article.  However it took me probably a full day of exploring that code and implementation to understand why it was not working, and to refactor my code so that it would.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>While wanting to use the archive layout from above on my category archives, I did not want to lose the untitled posts from these pages.  On the archive page below on programming the microposts are listed, but still presented in a very truncated fashion.  Note also the custom category introduction in the hero banner for this page.</p>
<p>There is a subtitles.html partial within my theme, which contains a series of if/else if/else statements, populating this area of the template based on the title of the page.  This has introduced a little weirdness where there is a page in my digital garden with the same name.  I can live with that for now, but will probably refactor soon to correct this.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>While that approach worked really well for the informational sections of my site, it did not feel so great for the more &lsquo;instagram&rsquo; sections.  I&rsquo;m probably the biggest reader of my site, and I wanted to be able to look at bayLee&rsquo;s section on my site, and scroll up from his posts as a puppy at the beginning, and see him grow up - without having to open each post to see what it contained.  So I have retained a more traditional archive page layout for these sections.  I have not had time to rewrite this layout, which is largely borrowed from Tiny Theme.</p>
<p>There is a piece of conditional logic in the list template which depending on the title of the category will either load in a partial with the more minimalist archive layout, or a partial with post previews.  In general terms pages about my canine children and Vickie are laid out in preview form, and components of my digital garden largely deploy the more minimalist approach.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Finally, the below post section on each post, and most pages, provides a visually clear way for the reader to say thanks for the time and effort that went into writing this, as well as information about when that page was last updated.  This felt particularly important for the more &rsquo;evergreen&rsquo; pages that collate and curate my digital garden.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>For the most part the development went really well, it probably took me a day to design the theme, and 3-4 days to revise and build the design onto Hugo.  I got a few things wrong along the way, and there are a few things that I would do differently next time.  I&rsquo;ll write a follow up article about the lessons learned.  If there is sufficient interest I may do a screencast on setting Hugo up ready for theming, which was definitely my biggest bar to getting going with this project.  I&rsquo;m pretty pleased with the outcome, I&rsquo;ve made a few revisions since the theme went live, and I&rsquo;ve a couple of minor tweaks left to do before I merge the amendments made live back into my github repo and local build.</p>
<p>I hope that you found the article interesting or useful.  If you did, please just click on the kudos button below to say thanks, or feel free to comment through micro.blog, mastodon or email using the links below..</p>

			 <p>As we move in to 2024 I wanted to take the opportunity to reflect on 2023, to identify what went well, what did not, and to set some foundations for the year ahead.</p>
<h2 id="planning">Planning</h2>
<p>Having set SMART objectives at the beginning of the year would have made it really easy to reflect on the year that has passed.  Having not done so makes it really hard to objectively measure performnce&hellip; so I will set some specific objectives where I can for 2024.</p>
<h2 id="work">Work</h2>
<p>Work was an unmitigated disaster.</p>
<p>In January 2023 I left a role that I had been very successful in across a number of years, to work for another consultancy.  All that I can say on this topic is that the role did not have the seniority and profile or autonomy that I expected and thrive under.</p>
<p>I left at the end of the year to take up a position as Head of Technical Services at another consultancy that I have a lot of respect for and trust in.  So 2023 was 💩, but the year ahead is an exciting one professionally.</p>
<h2 id="fitness">Fitness</h2>
<p>I entered 2023 weighing 81.77kg, and exited at 84kg.  That does not tell the full story though, peaking at 86kg in June, my weight has been gradually falling from there into the end of the year.</p>
<p>I spent 170h training in 2023.  From a promising position at the end of the summer, COVID and a deteriorating work-life combined to make for a pretty miserly end to 2023 - just 19 hours of activity in the last three months of the year.</p>
<p>Of those 19 hours, 4 were at one of my target races for the year - the Manchester Half Marathon, which I walked.  It really illustrates just how badly the end of the year went.</p>
<p>I have always used my fitness metrics as an indicator of the strength of my work life balance, and mental wellbeing - the peaks and troughs in that data show how consuming the year was at times.</p>
<h2 id="software-development">Software Development</h2>
<p>In January 2023 I completed a software engineering course with HyperionDev.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t set any objectives around this, but I&rsquo;d have expected to kick on and learn more in 2023.  There were probably some really obvious starting points as well, that course being threadbare on Flask and Django in particular.</p>
<p>I have learned a little through the year.  Moving and consolidating all of my websites into a single site on Micro.Blog has meant that I have had to learn quite a bit about the Hugo static site generator on which it sits.  That has culminated in me designing almost all of my own theme from scratch, which starts to think innovatively about how to make Micro.Blog do things that would have been much easier if the YAML frontmatter were exposed.</p>
<p>This is not completely new.  I have built much more complex sites / data structures in Jekyll on Github Pages in the past.  I think this is the most comprehensive theme that I have ever written though, without using third party components like bootstrap.</p>
<h2 id="social-media">Social Media</h2>
<p>At the end of 2022 I spent quite a lot of time looking for places to write with communities around them.  I stumbled across micro.blog, I also spent quite a bit of time looking at write.as, I looked at Ghost, and probably a few others too.</p>
<p>I found micro.blog intriguing, and though the web presence has been much improved over the last year, I really couldn&rsquo;t work out why everybody on Micro.Blog had built Hugo Websites.  Once I realised that I could both write to an audience, and to do that through my own websites, I was pretty sold.</p>
<p>I wrote about this more <a href="https://lee-perry.co.uk/2023/01/31/taking-ownership-of.html">at the time</a>, but have used micro.blog and its activitypub capability to eliminate more nefarious social media sources from my life.</p>
<p>That process is not complete though.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I still have Facebook, Instagram and Threads accounts.  I need the former mainly for the various virtual cycling groups I am in that organise themselves there.  Maybe after the Zwift Racing League is finished for the year I will be able to do something about that.  I do not need either the instagram or threads accounts.</p>

<li>
<p>I also still have a LinkedIn account.  I probably need to retain that for professional purposes, but need to be much more effective in my usage, avoiding doomscrolling there.</p>

<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>2023 was a really tough year, physically, but mentally as well.  I&rsquo;ve probably been to darker places in the last year than I ever have before, so it is cathartic to look back over on the year now.  I think that I&rsquo;m much better placed, and positioned in a much better place, for the year ahead.  So turning to the year ahead:</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I wrote yesterday about my visit to <a href="https://lee-perry.co.uk/2023/12/30/villa-park.html">Villa Park</a>.  Usually I&rsquo;d write about the game at the same time, but I want to organise this data better in this site, and I also wanted to organise my thoughts about this game better too.</p>
<p>On paper this was a very tough game against opponents second in the league, and who beat us with ease at Turf Moor <a href="https://lee-perry.co.uk/2023/08/27/burnley-v-aston.html">earlier in the season</a>.</p>
<p>In many ways Burnley&rsquo;s approach to the game showed how despite the rhetoric to the contrary, the playing style has evolved through the season.  The squad churn of the early weeks is gone, Kompany having settled on his best combination.  The only change from mid-week being Johann Berg Gudmundsson replacing Mike Tresor on right wing.  Gone too was the high press that Aston Villa went straight through in August, replaced with soaking up pressure at the back, while still playing out from the back, and countering through Villa&rsquo;s high press.</p>
<p>The game started as expected, plenty of Villa pressure and possession, generally coped with well.  Trafford saved an instinctive reflex volley from Ollie Watkins in the 13th minute, a good save, but one you&rsquo;d expect to be made.  Sadly Jordan Beyer had to be replaced shortly afterwards by Hannes Delcroix.  Having been integral to improved resilience at the back since his return to the team, lets hope he returns again before too long - thankfully the month ahead is very light on program.</p>
<p>The first Villa goal came shortly after the first decent spell of pressure from Burnley, in which Josh Brownhill forced Martinez into a save from a shot from range.  Again, a save that you would expect Martinez to make. Watkins drove out to left, before cutting back and across O&rsquo;Shea, placing the ball behind Bailey.  A fortunate deflection sent Bailey&rsquo;s strike straight into the roof of Trafford&rsquo;s net.</p>
<p>Burnley did not have to wait long for the equaliser.  Josh Brownhill floated in a free kick across the penalty box from the left wing.  The cross found the head of Dara O&rsquo;Shea, who played it back across the goal for Zeki Amdouni to acrobatically find, and to place in the roof of Martinez&rsquo;s goal.</p>
<p>It got better still shortly afterwards when Lyle Foster raced through from the halfway line to fire past Martinez, only for the linesman to raise his flag, and the VAR to confirm.  I&rsquo;m really struggling to be convinced that the lines were drawn properly, and can be drawn with sufficient accuracy to split two players that are as level as this.  I&rsquo;ve only seen one more marginal this this - which (not) coincidentally was also another disallowed Burnley goal earlier in the season where the lines had to be redrawn when they gave the wrong answer first time.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Villa went back ahead just before half time, Watkins taking the ball out to the left wing, and crossing for Diaby to fire home from close range.  Fatefully after the goal Sander Berge was booked for a tackle on Jacob Ramsey after a ridiculous passage of play which had lasted a good couple of minutes - and for which the referee had not awarded a foul, even after Burnley extinguished any advantage.  It was a soft yellow card, but would contribute to Berge&rsquo;s dismissal early in the second half for the tiniest of tugs on the shirt of Douglas Luis.  It was a nothing challenge, but Attwell did not hesitate to produce the second yellow.</p>
<p>Heading down to 10 men, I probably feared the worst, but Burnley played as well with 10 men as Villa did with 12.  The referee&rsquo;s most unforgivable mistake of the game coming on 60 minutes.  Foster charging on the Villa goal.  Diego Carlos got to the ball first, miscued it into the path of Foster, and then controls the ball with his left arm on the edge of the penalty area.  The handball was really obvious from the Upper Doug Ellis Stand over 100m away.  The referee is stood 20 yards away with a clear view of it.  Watching it back, the ball does not strike the arm, the arm changes position to control the ball which is flying on by.  It is a really shocking decision, it prevented Foster going through one on one with Martinez, and it should have resulted in a red card and a free kick.  If VAR does not intervene in something as appalling clear and obvious as that, then there is absolutely no point to it whatsoever.</p>
<p>Foster equalised on the 71st minute, racing through and firing below Martinez at his near post from the right.</p>
<p>Burnley managed the game well from here until on the cusp of 90 minutes Bailey got ahead of Charlie Taylor, playing across to Duràn, who promptly fell to the ground on the slightest of contacts from Aaron Ramsey who was playing the ball that he had intercepted.  It&rsquo;s debatable that there is any contact - certainly not sufficient to warrant the simulation on the floor in any case, and the referee is the wrong side of the action to see it either way.  If there is contact, it is with less of Ramsey&rsquo;s foot than the bit of Foster&rsquo;s foot that allegedly strayed offside.</p>
<p>It was a really good Burnley performance, with 5 shots on target to Villa&rsquo;s 7.  Maybe Villa edged it, but even they will feel fortunate to have escaped from that game with all three points - the comments from their fans on the match page on the BBC reflects that.  The officiating was appallingly bad - VAR was supposed to eradicate mistakes from the game, but it feels worse than ever.  The offside is really close, but fair enough.  Both Berge yellow cards are hideously soft. The penalty is really soft.  The handball is just plain wrong.</p>
<p>I hate sour grapes.  I&rsquo;ve tried to be really balanced on officiating and on our performances - but I can&rsquo;t recall another game where so many key, but marginal, decisions all went one way.  Stuart Attwell should reflect on his performance, PGMOL should on theirs too.  Neither will, as it was not an hysterical Liverpool or Man City on the wrong end of their shocking incompetence.  Dreadful, dreadful refereeing - not what any supporter in the ground pays to see.</p>

			 <p>My take, as a visiting supporter, of Villa Park.</p>
<p>Villa Park is the home of Aston Villa in Birmingham, with a capacity of 42,657 across the Doug Ellis, Holte End, Trinity Road and North Stands.</p>
<p>If you arrive before the roads close there is ample coach and car parking opposite the ground on Witton Lane.  You’ll find the program sellers dotted around there too.  £3.50 is amongst the cheapest programs in the Premier League this season.</p>
<p>The stadium is surrounded by food vendors, including at the expansive fan zone in front of the North Stand. There was even a wee concert going on there while I explored around the stadium.</p>
<p>My advice, as a travelling supporter, would be to get food and drink at one of those vendors - Smokey Joes have a number of stalls around the ground that looked really good.</p>
<p>Once you gain access to the Doug Ellis Stand, the concourse is really disappointing. In fact concourse is stretching it, the facilities in that stand could be politely and more accurately be described as a corridor.</p>
<p>Food and drink is served from a hatch in the corridor, a Mill Town beef and onion pie,  it was fine - a gentrified steak bake at best, and costs £5.30.  Which means that my Bovril must have cost an extraordinary £3.20. For a mug of hot water and a stock cube.  Not the worst pie or pricing this season, but disappointing all the same.</p>
<p>The toilets are just grim, and there is nowhere to eat and drink in the corridor, so you might as well just head through to your seat and eat there.</p>
<p>Don’t bother entering early, enjoy the facilities around the ground, even take a stroll around Aston Hall Park.  Avoid booking seats 1-17 of the Upper Doug Ellis Stand, especially below row GG - unless you want to stare at the back of a television.  You can thank me later!</p>
<p>The pre game fire and light show was perplexing.  The fire was nice, and you could feel the warmth from the jets.  But it was not dark, why the light show?</p>
<p>The stadium itself is excellent, a large classic ‘proper’ football stadium. Not a soulless bowl.  The steep terraced seating really adds to the atmosphere in the ground.</p>
<p>The facilities for visiting supporters though are easily the worst that I have seen so far in the Premier League this season.  Given that Villa might well make the Champions League next season, are cultured Barcelona and Monaco supporters really going to be greeted with that?  I suspect so.</p>

			 <p>The visit of Liverpool to Turf Moor was always going to be a tough game to try to build on the fine away victory at Fulham on Saturday.  With Man City and Arsenal, Liverpool are one of three teams who can realistically win the Premier League this year.</p>
<p>Out brightly, Burnley probably had the better of the first 5 minutes of the first half  Darwin Nuñez putting Liverpool ahead clinically in the 6th minute.  The remainder of the first half was painful viewing, and only a string of fine saves from James Trafford, and a foul in the build up to Gapko&rsquo;s disallowed goal kept the score to 0 - 1.</p>
<p>The second half was much better.  Another Liverpool goal was disallowed for offside interference with play from Mo Salah. From the 70th minute onwards Burnley looked much more likely to equalise than Liverpool to extend their lead.  None of the chances created could be taken, then Diogo Jota finished well from a difficult angle to extend the lead in the 90th.</p>
<p>Trafford had another fine game, if his distribution continues to improve, there is a really good goalkeeper in there.  Similarly Odobert terrorised the left wing again, carrying strong delivery and goal threat.  Foster looks stronger and sharper each game, and I thought that Amdouni had a really good game too, as did Beyer in defence.  Mike Tresor took a little stick from the crowd, but I though his ball control was excellent as Trafford&rsquo;s distribution lengthened, he did well at picking the ball out of the air, holding and taking it forward.</p>
<p>Burnley looked vulnerable to the Liverpool press playing out from the back.  Berge did not hit the levels that he can, with a couple of passes going astray in dangerous transitions.   Probably the biggest criticism is the lack of conviction to shoot in dangerous positions.</p>
<p>Next up on Saturday is Aston Villa at Villa Park.  Hopefully they will not feel too aggrieved at my first paragraph.  Villa, who are having an excellent season themselves, currently sit third in the league.</p>

			 <p>Leaving Burnley this morning, I wasn’t particularly optimistic. It has felt like a season where we have started to play really well, but rarely consistently and long enough to translate it into points.  I was much more excited about seeing a heritage football stadium and pie sampling than I was the football.  In fact I was feeling so uninspired about the football, that I started a whole new section on my site about <a href="/lists/service-stations/">motorway services</a> instead.  I recently stumbled across the full men’s blog on the facewall, which seems to have impacted my interests!</p>
<p>As usual I travelled down with Burnley Supporters Club, getting on the coach at 06:20 opposite Queensgate bus depot in Burnley.  Travelling down in no time to Norton Canes services on the M6 Toll, my plan to wait for the queue to go down before ordering a coffee at McDonalds, when the Fleetwood coach pulled in, followed by Watford and Everton.  The Watford lot were in vocal form, though given that they went to the dark side of Oswaldthwistle and won today, I’ll forgive them.</p>
<p>The stadium holds you outside a bit longer than other stadiums, it must have been at least 13:30 before we were allowed in. Before that we got to watch the bizarre spectacle of a box of stewards reserving drop off spaces for the incoming team coaches, pushing the waiting crowd in and out.  A bit perplexed as to why you would need to get a coach to your own stadium but still.</p>
<p>The Johnny Haynes stand is a delight, with the heritage red brick frontage, and what looked like timber seating to the rear of the stand.  The away section is in the Putney Stand, walking in past the cottage and what looks like an old police box.  The refreshment areas under the stand felt pretty unique in that the spare is shared by home and visiting support.</p>
<p>The praise stops there. Refreshment prices were ridiculous. £5.70 for a pretty ordinary looking pie felt obscenely expensive. Yes I can afford £6 for a pie, and no I absolutely won’t pay it.  The sausages looked amazing, but felt like far too much to eat. £9.50 for that beast felt much more sensible.</p>
<p>For some reason the Riverside stand is left deliberately half empty.  The stand on the left of the photos has two entire banks of the upper tier left completely empty.  It looks deliberate / planned - why?</p>
<p>The first half was a pretty poor performance.  We never really looked in trouble, but we did not look like we would threaten, it felt laggy, with no incision or pace, and there were a couple of really solid saves from James Trafford in the Burnley goal.</p>
<p>At half time Jacob Bruun Larsen was substituted out for Mike Tresor.  Burnley struck early in the half with Odobert, laid off by Foster, putting a world class finish into Leno’s top left corner, leaving the keeper with no chance.</p>
<p>We never really controlled possession like we can, but still looked fairly solid at the back despite a couple of whoupsies. Thankfully for once this season we were able to prevent the other side from capitalising on those moments in the game.</p>
<p>Around 20 minutes later Odobert teed up Sander Berge, who placed the ball pretty bluntly into Leno’s top right corner.  All contributing to a new chorus - you better watch out, you better not cry, Sander Berge is coming to town.</p>
<p>From that point forward Burnley managed the game out quite well, never looking like collapsing in the manner of the West Ham defeat.  We were definitely under pressure, but handled it well.</p>
<p>The game was also notable for Rebecca Walsh becoming the first female to referee a game in the Premier League.  For me she had a solid performance, controlling the teams well and getting the key decisions right. She was too accommodating of Fulham players falling over every time they were tackled. For a while there, it did not feel like we were allowed to actually tackle.</p>
<p>Delighted with the result, really struggled with my man of the match. Trafford played well, Berge had a solid game also, Foster turned and ran through a number of times, and just needs to release when thr opportunity opens up.  My man of the match nomination went to Odabert who terrorised on both wings at times, cutting in, and going round.  A stunning goal and an essential assist really wrapped it up for me.</p>
<p>I’ve felt from the beginning of the season that Koleosho on one wing and Odabert on the other is a very appealing combination, though sadly it will be the end of the season before that is possible.</p>
<p>Rumour has it that Nathan Tella was watching in the Cottage with Alan Pace… who walked right past us when we were waiting to get in.  Rumour mill in full flow.</p>
<p>Hope that you enjoyed the article, if you did please feel free to say so by clicking the give kudos button below, it makes me feel less like I’m talking to myself!</p>
<p>Liverpool next, on Tuesday at the Turf. Up the Clarets!</p>

			 <p>In the first of a new collection on my site, I decided to start documenting the various service stations that I visit. Just because.</p>
<p>Roadchef operated Norton Canes services sits on the M6 Toll not too far from Cannock.  It seems to be a popular stopping point for football traffic, with Burnley, Fleetwood, Everton and Watford all in this morning.</p>
<p>The services benefits from a McDonalds, Leon, Spar, Costa Coffee as well as a large seating area.</p>
<p>Outside the services is set in expansive wooded grounds with a good dog walk loop up to a monument providing views across the area from above.</p>
<p>Externally the services is complemented by a Costa drive through - which appears to be drive through only, and a BP filling station with Wildbean Cafe.</p>

			 <p>Selected as the Saturday evening game by Sky Sports, today marked the first return back to Turf Moor of Sean Dyche, James Tarkowski, and Dwight McNeill.</p>
<p>The two teams met just a <a href="https://lee-perry.co.uk/2023/11/01/everton-burnley.html">few months ago</a> in a somewhat turgid affair at Goodison, where Burnley dominated the ball, but could do little with it and were punished at the back.  The fear going into the game was a repeat of that.</p>
<p>On the back of a decent run of form, the Cricket Field Stand was as lively as I&rsquo;ve heard it this season, and the returning clarets were given a fine welcome, unlike some of the treatment handed out to Dwight at Goodison.</p>
<p>The team rewarded this too, with a lively first ten or fifteen minutes where Burnley were again very much on top.</p>
<p>Ten minutes in the Everton fans held their little pink &ldquo;Premier League: Corrupt&rdquo; posters up, and sang their &ldquo;Premier League Corrupt as &hellip;&rdquo; chant.  The irony that they were singing that song at the home of a team who  were relegated behind them in the years they were busily overspending should not be lost.</p>
<p>Authors of our own misfortune again, the team just do not seem to be capable of playing out from the back, inviting pressure.  Trafford made a fine save before the the first goal, but was beaten in the air from the following corner by Onana.</p>
<p>The second goal also followed a fine save by Trafford, but O&rsquo;Shea could only defect into the path of fellow claret diaspora member, Michael Keane.</p>
<p>I think both goals followed weak attempts to play out from the back, and O&rsquo;Shea was very fortunate not to concede a third with an appalling touch putting Everton clear.</p>
<p>We had our chances in the game.  Amdouni conspired not to score when it seemed easier to score than not in the first period.  In the second half Sander Berge struck the crossbar with force.  For the most part though we were reduced to efforts from range, and attempting to run through behind the defence.  The lack of penetration really hurts - especially once behind.</p>
<p>Some positives.</p>
<ul>
<li>In full flow, this team really begins to look like it belongs at this level, though in practice in needs to do that for much bigger periods of the game.</li>
<li>Lyle Foster, returning to the squad from illness, made his first appearance in a while, replacing Rodriguez at half time.</li>
<li>Manuel Benson also made his first appearance of any description since probably August.  His cameo of 15 minutes or so definitely produced better deliveries into dangerous areas, but lacked the firepower on the end of it</li>
<li>Al-Dakhil also came on for the first time in a month or so, replacing Hannes Delcroix who sadly still looks out of his depth at this level.  Al-Dakhil looked like he had regained some of his confidence and composure, after a tough start to the season.</li>
</ul>
<p>Its Fulham away next on Saturday 23 December, and I&rsquo;m getting very excited about my trip to Craven Cottage.  Another classic ground with lots of history - I can&rsquo;t wait to see it.</p>
<p>Until next time, up the clarets!</p>

			 <p>I remember categorically saying that I would not be going to Brighton, just a few weeks ago.  However, my Social Events Executive Vickie knew that I wanted to see the Amex, so she booked the coach and ticket anyway.</p>
<p>Getting up for the supporters club coach to leave Queensgate bus station at 06:20 was pretty rough on the back of my new employer’s Christmas party, arriving back from Stoke at 11.  Thankfully, I don’t drink - there is no way I would have been getting up.  It’s been a pretty attritious year for a number of reasons, so I’m pretty tired and hanging on for the upcoming break.</p>
<p>The ride down was largely smooth, stopping off at Sandbach for a hot chocolate on the way South.  We didn’t really hit any traffic until the M25.  By the time we hit that I had completed a decent slant of Meta’s backend developer course on Coursera (which I like so far - more another time).  Though I felt incredibly travel sick trying to complete the exercises after joining local roads.</p>
<p>We arrived at the  American Express Stadium around 13:30, before the full range of pies had been cooked in three concourse.</p>
<p>The concourse area for away supporters is pretty small at the Amex - expect to have to battle your way through the queues to get to the counter, toilets or out to the stands.</p>
<p>The food was very similar to the offer at Brentford.  The local pie seller here is Piglet Pies, with a pie and coffee costing £7.70.  The guest pie of the day was lamb kofta.  It tasted exactly the same as the chicken tikka pie at Brentford, though the pastry was far more robust.</p>
<p>For a bowl the atmosphere is fairly lively, though a highlight of the afternoon was some very high pitched voices screaming ‘who are ya?’ at us every couple of minutes, and their accompanying ‘adults’ with their monkey hand gestures.  Very refined.</p>
<p>We’ve been playing really well since the Brentford game, often not getting what we deserved from games.  This was probably the opposite, a good point taken from a team who were much stronger than us for all but the first 15 minutes.  I’ll take that right now.</p>
<p>After that Brighton began to dominate, but with Burnley looking threatening on the break - with Odabert looking a more than an able cover for Luca Koleosho, who will miss much of the remainder of the season following an injury picked up against Wolves on Tuesday night.</p>
<p>That’s particularly bad news, as Koleosho has provided many of the brightest moments of this season. At least micro.blog should stop filtering most of my football posts into my canine child “Leo” category for the next while.</p>
<p>Just before half time Odabert cut inside from the left wing, finding the top left corner of the goal with a slight deflection to assist.  Every time he cut in, Wilson created chaos in the Brighton defence.  Not sure he has Luca’s pace, but his end product feels less raw.  Both in the same team would be a frightening pairing.</p>
<p>Just after half time the score should have been extended to 2-0.  The initial shorting coming again from Odabert cutting in, and Rodriguez should have done much better with the rebound which he struggled to dig out with his feet.</p>
<p>After that it was one way traffic, relentless Brighton pressure paying off with an equaliser 15 minutes from time.</p>
<p>James Trafford made a string of fine saves in the Burnley goal, with a couple of world class saves in 8 agonising minutes of added time.</p>
<p>We’ve played much better this season for no return.  Despite their dominance, Brighton did not really look like scoring before their equaliser, many of the chances they had bring fired straight at the keeper from range, or off target.</p>
<p>I’ll wrap this up with a chant we’ve not really heard before:</p>
<p>I like it, I like it, I la-la-la like it, la-la-la like it…
Super James Trafford in Goal.</p>
<p>There’s a fantastic young stopper in there, just need to improve distribution and box control.</p>
<p>Up the clarets.</p>

			 <p>Growing up in Walsall, Birmingham New Street was the gateway to the rest of the world.</p>
<p>Arriving at the station bridge, I remember being greeted by a Burger King, and the escalators out of the dungeon below, into the dungeon that was the Pallisades shopping centre.  Only brightened by the presence of an Electronics Boutique at the top of the ramp down to McDonalds.</p>
<p>How it has changed, the Pallisades replaced by the large open expanse that is Grand Central.  To be fair, the views back across the station to Grand Central are stupendous, as are those to the Bullring and more so the Rotunda at the other end.</p>
<p>They ought to be.  A coffee will set you almost £4 at and vendor, and expect to spend most £3 on a cookie to go with it.  Needless to say I opted instead for a £5 WH Smith’s meal deal, my sandwich accompanied by a grab bag of crisps, and a litre of water for the train.  All despite finally locating a pret actually stocking my favourite crayfish sandwich.  Best part of £8 for a sandwich, in what felt like a giant freezer, was a step too far, all a world away from my childhood.</p>

			 <p>Burnley took on West Ham United today at Turf Moor Burnley.  Read on for a summary of the match, and photographs.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to keep this article short.  This is the third really good Burnley performance on the bounce, and all three of those games have ended in no points.  So while we are rapidly improving, that is not translating into points, and it is frustrating to see supposedly &lsquo;weaker&rsquo; sides picking up points against the same opposition - Luton getting a cracking result against Crystal Palace today.</p>
<p>So Burnley dominated this match for the first 86 minutes, deservedly leading through a Jay Rodriguez penalty at the beginning of the second half.</p>
<p>West Ham began to build pressure in the final 15 minutes, scoring not once but twice from moves beginning with crosses coming across the box from their right wing.  In part they were able to as their substitutions gave them more pace and incision up front, while Burnley&rsquo;s substitutions removed the balance in central midfield, and while Ramsay looked a class act in his cameo, removing Koleosho and Amdouni took our best players off the pitch.</p>
<p>Where the officials found 7 minutes of injury time from, in a pretty fluid second half, I&rsquo;ve no idea.  That is not why we lost though - and falling behind early in injury time there was absolutely no urgency on the ball to get back into it.</p>
<p>I was hoping for a good result today, and I thought that we could get something from this game - we definitely deserved too.</p>
<p>Though we look better and better each week - we look like we belong at this level at least now, I think we leave ourselves with far too much to do, as those around us - especially Luton and Bournemouth begin to pull away.</p>
<p>The last few months have been tough personally and professionally, so I was hoping for a little lift today.  If the result did not provide that, the amazing &ldquo;UTC&rdquo; corned beef pie I arrived home to came very close.</p>

			 <p>Talking about my learning to code, and completing the HTML Forms unit of the Intermediate HTML &amp; CSS module of the AppAcademy Open curriculum.</p>
<hr>
<p>One of my barriers as a developer is iterating between different learning routes, without finishing, and heading back to the beginning.  With the exception of the python based software engineering bootcamp that I completed with HyperionDev a year ago, I&rsquo;ve really failed to kick on and build on that.</p>
<p>Should I follow FreeCodeCamp, The Odin Project, or AppAcademy?</p>
<p>FreeCodeCamp orientates heavily towards learning by doing.  The Odin Project is incredibly theoretical in approach with vast amounts of material to read.</p>
<p>I find that I don&rsquo;t take in what I learn at FreeCodeCamp, iterating back to relearn the same material over and again.  I don&rsquo;t take in everything that I read at the Odin Project either, by the time that I come to use it.</p>
<p>For me AppAcademy&rsquo;s approach is somewhere between the too, more reading and instruction and underlying theory than FreeCodeCamp, but with a much faster cadence than the Odin Project.  Its probably the best of the three for my learning style.</p>
<p>So AppAcademy it is, and to keep myself accountable I&rsquo;m going to blog about the key assignments here as I complete them.  I&rsquo;ll also be recording my progress in a habit tracker I have created in my Obsidian vault.  Obsidian is probably a topic of its won for another time.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going back to the beginning though, I don&rsquo;t have anything to learn by going back over basic html/css and javascript that I already know pretty well.  So I&rsquo;m carrying on from where I left off a wee while back.  So today I worked on the HTML Forms unit.  HTML forms are not particularly difficult, but have always been anathema to me.</p>
<p>The content of the form is contained inside a form element, with an inner fieldset element.  The form element needs action and method properties.  The method, usually &ldquo;post&rdquo; dictates how the information collected is transferred, and the action provides the location on the server it is transferred through.  If a legend element is added inside the fieldset element, the form will be boxed with the content of the legend element as title.</p>
<p>Each of the components of the form are wrapped inside their own div blocks, each containing a label, and input(s).  As a general principle the label needs a &ldquo;for&rdquo; property, which must match the &ldquo;id&rdquo; property of the input(s) to which it relates.</p>
<p>Input elements need a type to be defined - in this example they include text/email/date/checkbox/radio, which tweaks the user inputs and data validation to reflect the expected data input.  Where multiple radio inputs have the same name property as one another, they will work together on a single selection only basis.</p>
<p>Textarea and Select are different - they have their own elements and are not input types.  The Select element must have the same id as the for value of its label, with option elements nested below for the choices, which will appear in a drop down list in the form.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a Replit embed providing a demonstration of all of the input fields described above, and to the specification requested by AppAcademy for submission.</p>

			 <p>Photographs and match review from Arsenal v Burnley at the Emirates Stadium.</p>
<p>Travelling down to London on the supporters club coach, the day had an early start, walking through a moonlit Burnley for an 06:20 departure opposite Queensgate depot.</p>
<p>The journey down was quite uninterrupted and pleasant until we arrived at Norton Canes services on the M6 Toll.  Instantly realising that every coach in the North was making its way to London today.</p>
<p>I’ve been getting really frustrated with mobile connectivity everywhere.  O2 does not seem to work at the Turf, on train or coach, or for half my drive to BoulderUK. When I try to talk to O2 about it, they do not get it. So I trialled a Vodafone PYG sim to test the network - which has worked flawlessly almost all of the day.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding, we made good time, arriving outside the Emirates for 12:30, with a full 2.5 hours till kick off.  Just enough time to collect my program and head round to the smart shop at Holloway tube station to pick up a lightning cable to replace the one I left at home.  The program looks pretty good.  At £4 it was the equal most expensive of the season so far, but also the biggest.  Not sure what I&rsquo;m doing with the fold out poster of Ben White though.</p>
<p>At 13:00 the stewards let us into the stadium, and I picked up a chicken balti pie, and a Lucky Saint alchohol free beer, £11.50.  Notably the pie had the first structural failure of the season, and a fork was needed. I’m blaming that on the pointless herb inclusions in the pretentious pastry.  I’d pass.</p>
<p>Burnley were always in the game, but the result was probably fair.  Arsenal dominated possession, but the chances were fairly even.  Burnley doing a much better job of getting behind the defence than in recent weeks.</p>
<p>Leandro Trossard rose to at the far post to put Arsenal ahead, on the stroke of half time, injuring himself in the process.</p>
<p>Brownhill levelled from a Koleosho cutback 10 minutes into the second half. Apparently there was some controversy, not sure why. If the defender can manhandle the attacker off the ball it stands to reason that the reverse is true.  Six of one and half a dozen of the other.  Good decision!</p>
<p>Parity did not last long, Trafford finding himself behind Saliba at the corner, who took the opportunity to head into the open goal.</p>
<p>Zinchenko rounded off the scoring in the 74th minute, meeting a rebound from the crossbar and firing it into the far top corner.</p>
<p>Viera’s didmissal in the 84th minute came too late.  With a man advantage Burnley found the overlap at will, causing problems, but not managing to get the ball in the back of the net.</p>
<p>Onafemi got his first minutes of the season at the end, and Aaron Ramsey returned for his first minutes in a month or more.</p>
<p>Not the drubbing many expected, but with Bournemouth winning at Newcastle, survival is beginning to look a bit more uphill.</p>
<p>Oh, and Arsenal have a drum. It was fucking annoying - we don’t need a drum.  Up the clarets.</p>

			 <p>Photographs and match review from Burnley v Crystal Palace, 4th November 2023.</p>
<p>After a month on the road, we returned to Turf Moor today, the opponents Crystal Palace.  Before that though, I had the small matter of a first visitation of my mother to Burnley.  Meeting her in town, we walked back up to Banny&rsquo;s on Manchester Road for lunch, and for her ride home.</p>
<p>Heading back into Burnley, the drizzle began, and it would continue throughout the afternoon.</p>
<p>This was the best Burnley performance I&rsquo;ve seen in about a month.  The first half in particular there was a bit more directness about our play, a faster turn of the ball, and a wealth of chances, albeit none of them clear cut.</p>
<p>Palace took the lead in the 13th minute, Jordan Beyer slipping in the corner, and outmuscled by Ayew who provided Schlupp with a straightforward tap in.</p>
<p>Palace doubled their lead in injury time at the end of the game, Burnley losing the ball up the pitch while pushing for the equaliser, leaving what was left of the defence exposed.</p>
<p>In between those two points Burnley dominated the game, without ever really creating clear cut chances.  Holding over two thirds of the ball, and with 17 attempts on gol to Palace&rsquo;s 4.  Other than a shot straight at James Trafford in the Burnley goal, every Palace shot on target went in.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s still a lot to do, but there is at least some hope from this performance of improvement.</p>
<p>One thing that irks me at the Turf is visiting supporters singing &ldquo;{insert town name} is a shithole, I want to go home&rdquo;.  It&rsquo;s obviously incredibly disparaging and rude, but the irony of a group of people who live in a concrete monstrosity divided by an open sewer singing it about pretty much anywhere else is not lost.  Feel free to stay at home.</p>
<p>Not the result that we wanted, or that I think the performance deserved - but at least green shoots.  Zeki Amdouni had a fantastic game and looked involved in most of the good link up play into the box.  Luca Koleosho terrorised again on the left wing.  Put better final delivery into either of those two, and goals will come.</p>

			 <p>Everton v Burnley at Goodison Park, Liverpool on 1 November 2023.</p>
<p>Leaving Burnley at 1620, I caught the supporters club coach at Queensgate.  Sadly too late in the day for Milltown Pies to be open.</p>
<p>We arrived outside Stanley Park about an hour before kick-off, picking up a program on the walk into Goodison Park. At £4, this is the most expensive program I’ve bought so far this season.</p>
<p>The ground is a proper old football ground, with old school food kiosks, and a wooden stand.  I don’t think I have ever sat in a stand with a wood floor before.  Though I love old grounds, and despise modern bowls, the hospitality in the stadium has not aged well.</p>
<p>To be fair, the food pricing was very sensible. A coffee and a burger set me back around £7.50.  However, there were no cheeseburgers left, and the burger that I did obtain was definitely dead, and clearly had been so for a large number of years.</p>
<p>This was the first game at Goodison since the death of Everton’s chairman, Bill Kenwright.  Commemorated with a minutes applause, enthusiastically supported by both sets of fans, with flowers laid on the centre circle.</p>
<p>As for the game, our distribution was clearly much better with Muric in goal. Though I do not really want to join the calls for Trafford to be dropped from goal, his distribution lacks confidence and pace, putting ourselves under pressure in dangerous locations.</p>
<p>As a result Burnley looked much more confident on the ball, dominating possession, but creating few clear chances, and lacking the incisiveness to really threaten goal.</p>
<p>Defensively undone by an unmarked Tarkowski header across goal in the 13th, before Everton were really in the game.  Onana scrambled the ball in somehow in the 53rd, with a final goal in injury time.</p>
<p>Burnley had 63% of possession, but never really looked like doing anything with it - it has to be time to start learning and fast.</p>

<p>It occurred to me though, that in continuing to use mainstream search engines, I was denying myself many of the benefits that I had designed into my own web presence for my visitors.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t go looking for an alternative approach to search.  This was not a problem that I really realised that I had, or had put much thought into until I heard <a href="https://micro.blog/manton">@manton</a> talking about Kagi briefly on the <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/586-micro-blogging-with-manton-reece/id493890455?i=1000630677336">Shop Talk Podcast</a> a few weeks ago.  At a similar time I also stumbled across Kagi&rsquo;s <a href="https://kagi.com/smallweb">Small Web</a> project, that takes me back to the curated internet of old.</p>
<p>So I decided to give the Kagi free trial (100 searches) a go.  I didn&rsquo;t necessarily expect to like it, or think that I needed it, but thought that it would be interesting.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Kagi is lightning fast, but what really struck me straight away is the cleanliness of the search results.  No adverts or featured posts, straight into the best search results for whatever the question was.  What else would you want from a search engine?  In the search below, I&rsquo;ve asked Kagi why I should pay for search, and sure enough at the top of the page is an extract from Kagi&rsquo;s help site explaining why you might.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>There are a number of advantages to this, not having to wade through a number of irrelevant featured links or ads is just the beginning.  I can now dare to search for Z Gauge model train sets, without being confronted by adverts of everything to do with trains on every website for the next month.</p>
<p>There are a few other Kagi projects I need to look into more. I mentioned the Small Web project above, which looks a really interesting project to get involved with, much like the webrings of old (and new, see below!).  There is also a browser project called <a href="https://browser.kagi.com">Orion</a> that looks great - though I&rsquo;m only really interested if it can load passwords from keychain using TouchID.  Otherwise I&rsquo;m sticking to Safari.</p>
<p>So I was sufficiently impressed with my 100 search trial (which lasted longer than I thought it would), to subscribe.  For now I&rsquo;m using the $5/mo which gives 300 searches per month, though I may switch us to the $14/mo Duo Family subscription with unlimited searches at some point in the future.</p>
<p>Anyway hope that you liked the article, and if you did please click below to give kudos, or to join the conversation.</p>

			 <p>A day out by rail to watch Burnley lose 0 -3 at Brentford in the Gtech / Brentford Community Stadium.</p>
<p>I could not get a place on the supporters coach today, so headed down to London on the train.  Despite the disruption from Storm Babet, the trains worked flawlessly in both directions.  I even managed to get an earlier train due to the advance cancellation of mine.  So strictly the weather made me an hour faster, and the travel was about 3h lighter in each direction for getting train rather than coach.</p>
<p>Once you get into London from the North, the best way to get to Brentford&rsquo;s stadium is to take the Victoria Line from Euston or Kings Cross to Victoria, and from Victoria to change onto the district to Gunnersbury.  Turn left on exiting Gunnersbury, and just keep going, the stadium will appear on your right as you approach Kew Bridge.  About an hour altogether.</p>
<p>I had the most intense entry search I&rsquo;ve had so far.  Every single section of my wallet was searched, so in future I&rsquo;ll take less to football.  The program seller is behind the search unit, approaching which felt like a scene from the Shawshank Redemption.</p>
<p>You enter straight into the concourse.  Don&rsquo;t feel like you have to eat from the kiosk here, there is another one upstairs that will be much quieter before the game as few know it is there.  Chicken Tikka Pie £5, bag of crisps, bottle of Peroni zero £11.</p>
<p>The away area is rail sit/stand seating, which is really growing on me.  The stadium is lovely, but its not found its rhythm yet, and the atmosphere outside the away end felt very subdued, despite the comprehensive home result.  At one point we were asking &lsquo;is this a library?&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The first half was the worst 45 minutes that I&rsquo;ve seen us play.  Out pressed in possession, while allowing space and the reset when not.  We give our opponents every advantage when we play like this.  Notwithstanding the performance, we very nearly equalised before half time but went in 1 - 0 down.  The main highlight of the first half was our new chant, to the tune of &lsquo;one of our own&rsquo; - We don&rsquo;t need a drum, We don&rsquo;t need a drum, we&rsquo;re Burnley FC, we don&rsquo;t need a drum.  If you have seen the furore around our advert for a drummer this week, you&rsquo;ll get it.</p>
<p>The second half was much improved, though we found ourselves in good positions a number of times, nobody wanted to shoot.  Koleosho missed an open goal too.  Ultimately we were outdone by two unstoppable finished from outside the box - we have to close down with much more urgency than we do today.  Trafford made some excellent saves in both halves, but his distribution needs to be faster an more accurate, and he needs to command his box better - he is being bullied by some teams as today.</p>
<p>I expected us to be in the game today.  We weren&rsquo;t.  We look a weaker side than the one that started the season, and we do not look like we are learning from our mistakes - I fear a long and difficult season unless there is an imminent uptick.</p>
<p>On the way back, just walk right past Gunnersbury, and turn left onto Chiswick Road, getting back on the District Line at Chiswick Gate.  About 1h15 all in.</p>
<p>Eventually made it back into Preston around 9pm.</p>

<p>Burnley probably had the better of the first half, and would have deserved to take the lead in to half time had they not been pegged back by a freak deflection off Ameen Al-Dakhil.  We have been put ahead by Wilson Odobert, finishing neatly across the goal from a Foster assist.</p>
<p>The least said about the second half, probably the better.  Shortly after the break Vitinho brought down Sterling who was probably going nowhere, giving Chelsea a penalty from which they never looked back.</p>

			 <p>Photographs from the game today.</p>
<p>Burnley had chances, could and should have scored at either end of the game. Between those two spells, they did not really look in the game.</p>
<p>Authors of their own misfortune again. Though Ramsay appeared to be fouled in the build up to Almiron’s screamer, not reviewed by VAR - he gave the ball away far too much today.</p>
<p>The second half penalty was a really poor penalty to give away - would have been better keeping tight and forcing a much more difficult cross / shot.</p>
<p>I was disappointed by Burnley’s performance - we need to put teams under pressure on the ball, and to turn through the phases much faster when we win it back.</p>
<p>The referee had a shocker - absolutely terrible performance.  Clearly you are not allowed to actually win the ball away to top 4 sides in the premier league.</p>
<p>Suspect a result on Tuesday away at Luton is key to getting this season going, if we cannot get something there I will begin to worry (Sadly I do not have a ticket).</p>

			 <p>Given Manchester United&rsquo;s midweek participation in the Champions League, this game took place in the somewhat novel / unusual 8pm slot on Saturday evening.</p>
<p>This was a really strong Burnley performance.  Every performance looks much better than the last, the defence looks much more solid, and but for Onana in goal, and his far post, Burnley would have left this game with at least a point.</p>
<p>The stats below speak for themselves, Burnley dominated possession and had an even share of the chances.  The irony in losing to a Man Utd long ball should not be lost.  &lsquo;Kings of all Europe&rsquo; they sang - but not even the best team from Manchester to visit the Turf this year.</p>

			 <p>The video assistant referee system was introduced into the premier league to eliminate controversial decisions from the game. Instead it has introduced more than I recall seeing before the system was introduced.</p>
<p>Here is an example from Nottingham Forest v Burnley last night, both images show potential handballs in the immediate buildup to &lsquo;goals&rsquo;.  Both were reviewed by the same VAR, Darren England.  England does not intervene in the first, he sends the referee to review the screen in the second.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>So some key points:</p>
<ol>
<li>These incidents are practically identical, they are either both goals, or they are not.</li>
<li>In sending the referee to the screen to review his decision, there is an assumption that the decision must be wrong - the referee is not making this decision, the VAR is.  Only very rarely does the referee stand by their on-field decision.</li>
<li>When the referee reviews the screen, they are shown only the footage that appears to be condemnatory, they are not shown other angles of the footage that appear to support upholding the original decision.</li>
</ol>
<p>Disallowing the second goal is clearly a bad decision.  However, the circumstances are identical, the decision maker the same, and their is no significant lapse of time between the decisions.  This cannot be simply dismissed as a bad decision - same individual, identical facts - why a different decision?</p>
<p>PGMOL needs to urgently explore, and explain, what it is about their referee&rsquo;s underlying belief and value systems that result in almost identical incidents like these being treated differently by the same reviewer just minutes apart.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Continuing to apologise for bad decisions made by VAR is simply not good enough.  Confidence in the integrity of the system and the individuals involved in it needs to be rebuilt.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>FWIW - on the balance of play the draw was probably a fair result last night, though it feels more like a couple of points dropped.</p>

			 <p>The game was evenly balanced, but the result hangs on two identical VAR reviews where the ball strikes a left shoulder in the build-up.  The Forest equaliser stands, Burnley&rsquo;s second does not.  Read on for my thoughts ➡️</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>#utc #burnleyfc</p>
<p>Ahead of the game, a point would have been a good result, but on the performance we will be disappointed not to have won.</p>
<p>Burnley started very nervously.  After the first 15 minutes we took control of the ball, slowed the game, and never really looked threatened. What we seem to lack, in control of the ball, is penetration through the centre.  Trésor and Berge seemed to add more penetration through the centre of the pitch in the last 30 minutes.</p>
<p>Some high points. Another incisive and electric Koleosho performance, tearing the world cup winning Montiel to pieces for the first hour.  Amdouni and Foster looked very dangerous too.  Much more solid at the back too, with Charlie Taylor stabilising the left side of the field, allowing Koleosho to be much more progressive.</p>
<p>VAR had a shocker though - little point to a review system that interferes in marginal decisions and continually gets them wrong.</p>
<p>As fantastic a finish as Hudson-Odoi&rsquo;s was, if that was a goal then Foster&rsquo;s was too.  I thought so, the entire commentary team did too. No complaints about the Foster red card in injury time though - though I don&rsquo;t really doubt that VAR will let many of those go this year too!</p>
<p>VAR is supposed to take the controversy out of decisions, not make it - Darren England should spend some time in the sin bin himself for his performance tonight.</p>
<p>Thats our first point on the board again, and we&rsquo;ll go again on Saturday.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://lee-perry.co.uk/2023/09/14/replacing-social-media.html">👨🏼‍💻 Replacing Social Media Noise with RSS Feeds</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://lee-perry.co.uk/2023/09/14/replacing-social-media.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2023-09-14 22:20:36 &#43;0000">Sep 14, 2023</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>It is far too easy to lose hours and days into social media and news feeds that could otherwise be productive.  In this article I talk a little about how I have used RSS feeds this year to avoid most social media and news sites, providing more focus to my reading time.  I&rsquo;ll also talk about where that has not been possible.</p>
<p>I talked in an <a href="https://lee-perry.co.uk/2023/01/31/taking-ownership-of.html">earlier article</a> about how I had begun to use micro.blog to consolidate my own internet presence, replacing almost all of my personal projects into a single Hugo, micro.blog powered website.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve similarly aimed to cut down the amount of time that I have spent in the past aimlessly wandering around the digital universe reading crap.  So much more than replacing my various web projects, that site also replaces any interactions I previously had on Twitter, Instagram etc through the activityPub / Mastodon API integrations.</p>
<p>Consuming news is another area where it is possible to get sucked into a vacuum of nothingness, either through reading news on social media sites, or endlessly trawling the media outlets that inevitably leads towards.</p>
<p>To prevent that I have set Screentime preferences within MacOS/iOS that prevent viewing most news sites.  I also stumbled back upon RSS feeds which I&rsquo;ve not really used for a decade or longer.  By controlling RSS subscriptions very tightly, I have an application that gives me selected news that I have chosen about the subjects I actually want to read about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Burnley FC</li>
<li>Web design and development</li>
<li>Human rights law</li>
<li>Burnley FC</li>
<li>Cycling</li>
<li>Constitutional Law</li>
<li>Burnley FC</li>
</ul>
<p>I primarily use an application called Unread RSS to do so.  I think I originally stumbled across it as a shoutout in the <a href="https://micro.blog/gluon">@gluon</a> micro.blog client.  Unread does have some disadvantages, so if you are not using iOS, or you want to use on the desktop, it will not be the feed reader for you - though most have a similar feature set.  On my Chromebook for example I use an application called Feeder instead.</p>
<p>Opening up in Unread I am presented with a chronological list of articles from the feeds that I have opted to subscribe to.  As I have subscribed to Unread, I am able to use the application to cache articles and the media within them for reading - which is important as my phone has connection in public and transit, but always objects to me doing anything with it!</p>
<p>In reading the article there are a number of things that I can then do with it.  I can save for future reading, copy, message or mail the link to the article, mail the article content.  I can even add articles to my safari reading list.  If I want to, I can click through to the article on the web.</p>
<p>There are a number of reasons why reading in an RSS reader might be preferable though:</p>
<ul>
<li>No adverts</li>
<li>No tracking cookies</li>
<li>Cleaner reading experience
So I have unread set to retrieve the article and embedded media, not just the more limited abstract from the feed itself.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;ve not managed to get rid of all traditional media channels though.  I&rsquo;m still stick with Facebook, which most of the virtual cycling groups that I&rsquo;m involved with still use to organise themselves.  Though many have embraced Discord, most of the organising still happens over on Facebook (I&rsquo;m not sure Discord is much healthier in any event).  Similarly with Messenger, as certain people still only talk to me on Messenger, it means that I cannot get rid of Meta completely - though I have managed to pretty much abandon Instagram, and its sibling Threads.</p>

			 <p>The third of three home games at the beginning of the Premier League Season, none of which we&rsquo;d have expected to win, though we would have hoped to steal a point or two out of Villa or Spurs - that was not to be.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Aspects of the performance were amongst the best we have seen this season so far, others amongst the most frustrating.  The BBC call this performance a <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/66625192">thrashing</a>, I&rsquo;d question if they actually watched the game.  The statistics speak for themselves - the scoreline might be heavy, but this was a competitive game, in which Burnley created lots of chances.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Burnley dominated the beginning of the game, culminating in an early goal for Foster, off the back of Koleosho&rsquo;s pace down the left wing.</p>
<p>The first Tottenham goal came from a very effective counter. Two on two Son was given far too much room at the back post, and punished us for it.</p>
<p>The second goal came from a weak clearance to Romero, not closed down on the edge of the penalty area, he put the ball in the far top corner of the net - leaving Trafford no chance.  The timing was unfortunate, in injury time at the end of the first half.</p>
<p>The third goal came from James Maddison, very similar, left with far too much space around the D, he placed the ball in the opposite corner, again giving Trafford no chance.  Such a shame that his obvious talent with the ball is degraded by his rather less talented theatrics whenever he loses it - something the referee was largely wise too, and while he did not reward it, he did not punish it either.</p>
<p>Fourth goal, the ball was played back to Son a little behind the penalty spot, who again left Trafford with no chance, putting the ball in that same corner.</p>
<p>Fifth goal, the ball was played in-front of Son from the halfway line, finding him near the D,  this time beating Trafford at his near post.</p>
<p>The introduction of Jack Cork shortly after brought some solidity back to the centre of the pitch, and Burnley would dominate the final half-hour of the match.  A couple of opportunities went unrewarded, before Josh Brownhill sliced the ball past Vicario, rolling in off the far post.</p>
<p>A few observations.</p>
<p>Our playing out from the back is too flat-footed - we are being pressed back onto our goal line, rather than effectively moving forward.  So when we lose the ball, we lose it in dangerous positions.</p>
<p>At the other end of the pitch, we are not pressing the opposition, allowing them to build momentum from the back in a way that we currently cannot.</p>
<p>We give the ball away far too often - especially when we are moving forward, leaving us vulnerable to quick counter-attacks.  And when we do so we are allowing very dangerous footballers far too much time and room on the ball - and we are being punished for it far too often.</p>
<p>Ironically, for Burnley, we keep getting caught out by long balls over the top too, so suspect our defence is committed too high up the pitch, without the pace that the attackers we are facing seem to have, to get back.</p>
<p>One thing is for sure - this is the most exciting team Burnley have had in many decades.  Sort the defensive frailties out, and it will move up the table.</p>

			 <p>Photographs from our game away at Nottingham Forest in the second round of the Carabao Cup last night.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Probably the most noticeable change was the return of Muric between the sticks.  Though you always have your heart in your mouth with Muric in goal, it did seem to instill a bit more confidence and decisiveness in defence.</p>
<p>In the first half Burnley showed that they really can compete against Premier League teams in a way they failed to do so against Man City and Aston Villa.</p>
<p>In the second, Zeki Amdouni took his chance to put Burnley ahead infront of the visiting fans in the Bridgford Stand.  Wilson Odobert narrowly missed a chance to put Burnley two up, and Nathan Redmond had looked bright early in the half too.</p>
<p>Forest had their chances, and always looked dangerous on the break, but could not convert.</p>
<p>A new chant echoed around the City Ground.  Picture &ldquo;Ooh, Zeki Amdouni&rdquo; - to the tune of Seven Nation Army.  I suspect it won&rsquo;t be the last time we hear that.</p>
<p>An 01:30 crawl into bed was a shock to the system, doubt I&rsquo;ll make a habit of travelling to midweek away games!</p>

			 <p>I decided to race with ART on Zwift today rather than with WLVR on indieVelo.  If indieVelo has a weakness, much like RGT, it is the weakness of the back of the field - and I wasn&rsquo;t really in a good place to be racing by myself today.</p>
<p>Was also pleased that the autocat let me into D+, even though strictly I sit in Cat C.  That meant that in theory, I could be competitive, more so if I hadn&rsquo;t hung on to the ZSun category C ride for 90 minutes the evening prior.</p>
<p>The Climbers Gambit course is a beast.  Largely rolling with a couple of decent climbs through the dinosaurs.  The last 6km are a relentless trawl from sea level up to the Epic KOM banner.</p>
<p>I started off well, firmly holding the top 10 for the first half, but not doing especially well through the primes (point-scoring segments for those who have not raced on Zwift).  Things unraveled from halfway onwards after helping bridge to the group at 8th, the enlargened group promptly dropped me at the beginning of the climb, which I spent ensuring that I was not caught by 13th (I refuse to finish in 13th, so would have to let 14th past too!).  At one point near the top I caught right up to 11th - but the energy burned meant that I had nothing to respond with as they again pulled away.</p>
<p>I was happy with my performance overall, but I could have been much higher on slightly fresher legs.</p>

			 <p>First game back at Turf Moor in over a fortnight due to the reconstruction works at Kenilworth Road.</p>
<p>I got the the Fanzone a little later than I&rsquo;d have liked, and due to the queues opted to just grab a pie and a mug of bovril from the concourse - which was actually ace.</p>
<p>First half was really tough.  We generated little from positions out wide, which would culminate in Manuel Benson&rsquo;s replacement at half time, and were especially vulnerable at right back.  Very quickly behind, we entered half time 0-2.</p>
<p>The second half was much stronger, a goal from Foster at the beginning of the half, and a few near misses in a spell where Burnley looked more likely to equalise.  The third ball came from another counter direct through the centre - the type of attack Burnley will need to deal with better as the season goes on.</p>
<p>Next up Nottingham Forest away in the Carabao Cup on Wednesday.</p>

			 <p>This video walks through how to install Championship Manager 01/02 on MacOS, how to update the data, and how to patch the game for enhanced functionality.</p>
<p>I have put together this new approach using UTM and Windows XP because:</p>
<ol>
<li>this method is cost free</li>
<li>due to DirectX errors on M2 series MacOS machines.</li>
</ol>
<p>I cannot test on M2 - but I expect this methodology to work given the emulation of the entire OS.</p>

			 <p>This video walks through how to share files between the Virtual Windows XP Machine that we created in UTM, and the filesystem on your MacOS machine.</p>
<p>This is a really boring video - but you will need to know how to set this up, to be able to transfer game installation files and patches to use on the virtual machine (other than ISOs which can be directly mounted).</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The only prerequisite is that you need to have installed a Windows XP Virtual Machine on your Mac using UTM.  If you have not come across the video, click through <a href="https://lee-perry.co.uk/2023/08/13/creating-a-windows.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>Main Steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a local network on your XP machine - set is to file and printer share, or turn off the firewall completely.</li>
<li>Shut down the virtual machine.</li>
<li>Change the network type in UTM from VLAN to shared network.</li>
<li>Reboot the machine.</li>
<li>Obtain the IP address of the local network that you created.</li>
<li>Connect to that network in MacOS using Go &gt; Connect to server in finder.</li>
<li>Enter your IP address as follows <code>smb://192.168.xx.y</code> replacing x and y as appropriate.</li>
<li>Enter your username which will be <code>Administrator</code> and password which I left blank.</li>
<li>Select SharedDocs to mount the entire Shared Documents Area.</li>
<li>You will need to repeat points 6-9 periodically if the network is disconnected.</li>
</ol>

			 <p>This video walks through how to install a Windows XP virtual machine on MacOS using a piece of software called UTM, to play old windows games in.</p>
<h3 id="why">Why?</h3>
<ol>
<li>Some old windows games are just amazing and inimitable, if you are looking at my site, you probably agree already.</li>
<li>From PlayOnMac to Parallels then Crossover, Apple finds a way of breaking my retrogaming approach.  I have received a number of comments from people stating that DirectX errors prevent some games playing in Crossover on M2 machines and/or MacBook Pro.</li>
<li>Unlike Crossover, and Parallels before it, UTM is free - though it may well be worth paying to download from the App Store to get automatic updates.</li>
</ol>

<li>Windows XP bootable ISO - preferably SP3</li>

			 <p>How to use Automator to create a lean approach to working with screen captures on MacOS.</p>
<p>I have created a shortcut in Automator to import files landing in my screenshots folder into photos, and delete the source files.</p>
<p>To make this work properly I needed to edit the shortcut configuration in vscode, and set <code>shouldDeleteSourceFiles</code> to <code>true</code> - this setting does not appear in the Automator GUI.</p>
<p>I have set that up identically, so that irrespective of MacBook, iMac or iOS, the workflow is the same.  I just need to then export the image from photos to reduce size ready for the internet.</p>
<p>Came about as I realised that I was uploading 20GB screenshot png files from my iMac direct onto this website, without resizing or compression by the Micro.Blog applications.</p>

			 <p>A quick preview of the new personal records section available in the profile section in the Rouvy application.</p>
<p>At the end of my Rouvy ride this afternoon I was congratulated on completing my longest ride and biggest climb.  I thought that this was weird given that I have ridden slightly further, and climbed significantly greater recently.</p>
<p>Looking at my profile section in the application after the ride, I noticed this section which I&rsquo;ve not seen before keeping track of in month and all time records for:</p>
<ul>
<li>FTP</li>
<li>Longest ride</li>
<li>Biggest climb</li>
<li>Energy Burned</li>
<li>1/5/20 minute power.</li>
</ul>
<p>The main caveat being that those records seem to all come from todays ride, so I&rsquo;m guessing these features have been introduced in update 2.28.1.99, and only work going forwards / do not look back.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure yet whether the FTP within the application will be updated automatically based on these results.  My FTP is set higher than these numbers, so will be interesting to find out, though I&rsquo;ll save that for another day given the run threshold session that I have tomorrow!</p>

<hr>
<p>I headed over to the Fountaine Inn at Linton to meet up with Burnley Mountaineering Club for the first time today.</p>
<p>Linton itself is a quaint wee village, with a little parking around the central green, which the Inn is set on, with Linton Beck passing through en route to the River Wharfe.</p>
<p>The route crosses over the Beck, turning right immediately after leaving the village, heading through fields on the level to Threapland, then around Cracoe and Rylstone.  Look at for St Peter&rsquo;s Church at Rylstone which is striking, and the old Massey Ferguson parked up in front, even more so.</p>
<p>After crossing Washfold Beck, we climbed sharply up on to the ridge, almost all of the climb for the day inside a mile or so.  Climbing over the style on the ridge, we took in the views downhill back towards Skipton to the right before turning left on the short walk up to the Rylstone Cross.  We then followed the ridge along to the war memorial Obelisk marking the high point of Cracoe Fell, following the path along the ridge under Thorpe Fell Top, before dropping into the village of Thorpe, and back to the start at Linton.</p>

			 <p>How to complete the &lsquo;Siege of Canaan&rsquo; scenario of the Ascent of Egypt campaign in Age of Empires.</p>
<hr>
<p>This video play through shows how to successfully complete the Siege of Canaan scenario in Age of Empires.</p>
<p>Unlike the most recent missions played, this scenario starts back at the beginning of time in the Stone Age.</p>
<p>The key to completing this task is developing your civilisation without discovery by the enemy until you are strong enough not to be overwhelmed by their incursion.  As the enemy occupies a hill overlooking your village, with a guard tower, that is not especially easy to do.</p>
<p>To improve your chances of non-discovery move your starting forces back behind your barracks, and make sure that none of your village movements happen North of the barracks either.</p>
<p>Split your villagers between collecting wood (first at the South of your island, later to the East), and foraging.  Advance the civilisation at the town centre once you have the resources to do so, and build a granary and marketplace so that you can transit your foraging villages to farming.</p>
<p>Build an archer range and stables, and advance the civilisation again once able to do so.  Build a siege workshop and at this point, you have sufficient gold for 2 catapults - build them, and supplement your force of axemen, and add some slingers and more bowmen to it.</p>
<p>At this point, you are in a position to take control of your own island.  Edge the two catapults north of your barracks, and take out the enemy guard tower once it comes into sight.  Protect the catapults with your army, and train it on the large enemy force that will approach from both sides.</p>
<p>Once you have defeated this force, the enemy will not approach you on your island again.  Build a gang of villagers, and construct a storage pit on the hill above your village, set the team to work collecting gold and stone.</p>
<p>Create a second Ganga of villagers, and do the same with the hill behind, which is also on the same island.  You will now be accruing stone and gold rapidly - use it to procure every research that you can - particularly those from the government centre improving the range and alchemy of your catapults.</p>
<p>Take the opportunity to add another catapult or two to your force, and replenish your army where you lost resources in the earlier battle.</p>
<p>Once ready to attack the enemy island, slowly approach the water crossing.  Use your catapults to demolish buildings, and your army to wipe out the large bands of enemy soldiers that approach.  If you have applied all of the civilisation and research upgrades available, you will deal with these forces much easier than earlier.</p>
<p>Set the catapults to wipe out each enemy guard tower as it comes into view, and then the surrounding buildings. Use your army to protect your catapults, and once the area is clear, carry on up the hill.  Once you demolish the enemy government centre at the top of the hill to the North of the map, victory will be yours!</p>

			 <p>How to complete the &lsquo;A Wonder of the World&rsquo; scenario from the Ascent of Egypt learning campaign in Age of Empires.</p>
<hr>
<p>The objective of the &lsquo;A Wonder of the World&rsquo; scenario is, unsurprisingly, to build a wonder - a pyramid in this case.  This video play through demonstrates how to complete the scenario.</p>
<p>The end-term objective is to build a pyramid, and to do that you will need a stockpile of 1,000 each of wood, gold and stone.</p>
<p>To do that though you are going to have to take control of the ocean.  You will need to obtain stone deposits from an island to the extreme of the map, and gold through trade.</p>
<p>You will come under attack from the sea very early in the game.  Similar to the previous mission, start by turning your villagers to collecting wood, and your docks to building scout ships.  Upgrade these scout ships to War Galleys as soon as you can, and again later in the game upgrade to Triremes and research catapult Triremes once available.</p>
<p>Once you have taken control of the seas you will probably not come under naval attack again (I  did not).  Position your boats to guard the approaches to your delta, and set them to stand ground.</p>
<p>Now you have a pretty free reign - set your villagers to food and wood production, and build trade ships to trade resources for gold with the two friendly (not red) docks to the East of the map.  Take the opportunity to carry out the civilisation upgrade when it appears, and you should then have the option to construct the pyramid, which you can commence so long as you are holding the minimum resources set out above.</p>
<p>The construction will take quite a while though, so set as large a team as possible on it to speed things up.</p>
<p>Once the pyramid is built, victory is yours!</p>

			 <p>How to complete the &lsquo;Naval Battle&rsquo; Scenario in the Ascent of Egypt learning campaign in Age of Empires.</p>
<hr>
<p>In the Naval Battle scenario, you need to retrieve the artefact being held by the enemy on the main island to the North of the map.  This video play through shows you how to do it.</p>
<p>The immediate priority is to deal with the immediate naval threat building across the water - if you do not do this your own island will come under constant attack, making success much harder.</p>
<p>Set your villagers to collect wood.  At the dock upgrade the Scout ship to War Galley, and build boats as quickly as you can collect wood.  Once you have a force of 5-6 galleys, take them off to the North East of the map destroying any enemy boats and dock that you find while being careful to keep the galleys out of range of the enemy watch towers.</p>
<p>Once you have dismantled the enemy&rsquo;s naval capability, use this force to remove any buildings and people that you can reach from the shore.</p>
<p>Back on your island, set your villagers to collecting and farming food, growing the population to collect the gold deposits.</p>
<p>At the dock build a light transport.  Build a siege workshop, and produce a catapult.  Build a Barracks with a couple of axemen and slingers.</p>
<p>Put these units on the light transport, and sail them to the landing area that your naval force has been carefully preserving.  Use the catapult to destroy enemy buildings - starting with military infrastructure and then the watchtowers, while using the axemen and slingers to protect the catapult from direct attack.  If you want to go faster, build a second group and send that across too.</p>
<p>You will find the artefact inside a walled area.  Take control of it by moving one of your axemen close to it, escorting both back to the light transport ship.  Send the ship back to your island and disembark it - and victory will be yours!</p>

			 <p>How to complete the &lsquo;River Outpost&rsquo; scenario in the Ascent of Egypt learning campaign within Age of Empires.</p>
<hr>
<p>This vide play through show you how to complete the River Outpost scenario in Age of Empires.  The real objective is to show you how to extend government into new zones of the map.</p>
<p>The objective island is right in the middle of the map.  You can&rsquo;t really miss it as you will be being shot at as soon as you find it.</p>
<p>Fortunately the military challenges are very limited on this map - you need to conquer the island, but you will not otherwise come under attack.</p>
<p>Set your villagers to collect food, wood and gold from around your town centre in the ordinary way.  You will need to build a dock, government centre and siege workshop as a minimum.</p>
<p>Once you have constructed the siege workshop, build a catapult.  The catapult can fire at the nearest guard post on the island from your shore.  Set it up and fire at the tower until destroyed.</p>
<p>Build a transport ship, and transport the catapult onto the island.  Carefully destroy each tower, killing any lions and crocodiles when you get the chance to do so.</p>
<p>Use the transport to bring a gang of 5 villagers across, build a storage pit, and get the team to mine stone.  Bring another gang of villagers across, and use them to build a town centre, and two watch towers.</p>
<p>Look to your town centre, and begin the civilisation upgrade.</p>
<p>Finally, look to your granary on the main island.  Select the option to upgrade your watch tower to a sentry tower, and then to a watch tower.  Once those upgrades complete, victory is yours!</p>

			 <p>How to complete the &lsquo;Crusade&rsquo; or &lsquo;Religion&rsquo; scenario in the Ascent of Egypt learning campaign in Age of Empires.</p>
<hr>
<p>The objective of the &lsquo;Crusade&rsquo; or more recently politically correctly renamed &lsquo;Religion&rsquo; scenario is to convert the enemy catapult to your side, and bring it back to your town centre alive.  This video play through shows you how to complete that.</p>
<p>It is possible to complete this mission relatively quickly.  Build up a large enough force of axemen, slingers and archers to hold off the enemy.  Focus your priest on the catapult, and bring it back to the town centre while the battle rages.</p>
<p>This play through takes a much more conservative approach, making the village secure first, and then attacking.  Set the villagers off at the outset to collect food, stone and wood in the usual manner.  I used the stone to fortify the approaches to the village, and then mined the gold deposit to the East of the town centre - using this to upgrade the priest.</p>
<p>While doing so I had build up an army of axemen, slingers and archers, which I had grouped using Ctrl+1,+2 etc, and had allocated the priest his own group (3).  Sending the first two groups East of the town centre they were soon engaged by the enemy.  Spotting the enemy catapult I quickly selected my priest using the hotkey (3) that I had allocated, and trained him on the catapult.  Onc the conversion is complete the catapult will happily help to slay remaining enemy forces while making its way slowly back to the town centre.</p>

			 <p>How to complete the &lsquo;Trade&rsquo; mission in the Ascent of Egypt learning campaign in Age of Empires.</p>
<hr>
<p>This video playthrough shows how to complete the Trade mission.</p>
<p>Similar to the previous mission, before you can turn your mind to trade, you need to deal with a few security threats from your neighbours.</p>
<p>First of all, set your villagers to collect wood, you are going to need a lot of it in this mission.</p>
<p>With the villagers busy, you will come under naval attack early on - build a fleet of at least 3 x scout ships and use them to protect the dock, and land approaches to your settlement from the West.</p>
<p>Create additional villagers, setting them to food production, using the output to build a fleet of axemen and archers.  Position them to the West of the settlement from where any threats will come.</p>
<p>After seeing off the enemy catapult, you probably will only encounter very trivial threats.  Build a fleet of trade ships, and set your villagers to food production.  When the trade ships are built, click on them to select the commodities that you wish to trade, and then navigate them into trading docks on the map.  Your gold stockpile will begin to build.</p>
<p>You also need to build a stockpile of gold.  Build a gang of 5 villagers, and send them up the hill to the East of the settlement where they can build a storage pit, and mine stone.</p>
<p>Once the stone and gold stockpiles reach 1000 each, victory is yours.</p>

			 <p>How to complete the Farming mission in the Ascent of Egypt learning campaign on Age of Empires.</p>
<hr>
<p>While the object of the farming mission is to teach you how to farm, that objective needs to be balanced by keeping the enemy at bay.</p>
<p>Seize the initiative - if you can take control of the sea crossings early in the game you can avoid having to deal with continuous waves of enemy attacks on your settlement.  Set your villagers to collect wood, build a dock, and use additional villagers to forage berries so that you can make more axemen and slingers.  Build a small landbased force.</p>
<p>Once you have control of the water, and have destroyed the enemy dock, use your naval and land based units to dismantle the enemy&rsquo;s military buildings, to prevent it from building a force to harm you with.</p>
<p>With the map now firmly in your control, build a market, and set your villagers to building farms - they will rapidly accrue the 800 food needed to complete the mission.</p>
<p>Finally, move your land force West on the map, until you discover and take control of the ruin.</p>
<p>Once your food deposits reach 800, victory will be yours.</p>

			 <p>How to install and patch Championship Manager 03/04 on MacOS M series computers using Crossover.</p>
<hr>
<p>For some reason, installing Championship Manager 03/04 was a very popular article on my MacRetro project (I prefer CM0102).</p>
<p>This video provides a step by step walk through of how to install and patch the game to play without a physical CD-ROM - one of the most common comments on that site before migrating it here.</p>
<p>You will need:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://oldgamesdownload.com/championship-manager-season-03-04/">iso</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.gameburnworld.com/dl/dl.php?file=ChampionshipManager03-04v4.1.2FixedexeEng.rar">patch</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>external links provided for convenience only - always virus scan prior to using</strong></p>
<p>Let me know using the &lsquo;reply by email&rsquo; functionality below should these links cease to function.</p>
<p>As I prefer <a href="https://lee-perry.co.uk/macretro/championship-manager-0102/">Championship Manager 01/02</a> this will likely be my only post on CM03/04, though never say never.  Installation in Playonmac should work on Intel machines though I&rsquo;ve not tested (Instructions for Crossover should work on Intel/M1 and M2 MacOS).</p>

			 <p>How to apply Nick&rsquo;s patcher to your Championship Manager 01/02 install on MacOS - correcting game year, competition names and much more!</p>
<hr>
<p>This is the sixth and final article in my updated series, walking through how to install and update Championship Manager 01/02 on MacOS with M1/M2 processors using Crossover.  Earlier in the series:</p>

<li><a href="https://lee-perry.co.uk/2023/05/31/install-championship-manager.html">Install Championship Manager 01-02</a></li>
<li><a href="https://lee-perry.co.uk/2023/06/01/patch-championship-manager.html">Patch Championship Manager 01-02 to 3.9.68</a></li>

<li><a href="https://lee-perry.co.uk/2023/06/03/add-tactics-packs.html">Import Championship Manager 01-02 tactics packs</a></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="why">Why?</h3>
<p>Highlights of Nick&rsquo;s patch include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Updated game year</li>
<li>Updated competition names</li>
<li>Manager profile fixes to make new jobs, especially foreign, easier to obtain</li>
<li>Remove stadium expansion limits</li>
<li>Reveal hidden characteristics</li>
<li>Reveal your star players</li>
<li>Remove un/protected contracts</li>
<li>Reduce processor usage</li>
<li>Remove foreign player limit</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how">How</h3>
<p>First of all you will need to get hold of a copy of Nick&rsquo;s patcher.  You can find that latest version on the <a href="https://www.champman0102.net/viewtopic.php?f=72&amp;t=1392">Champman0102</a> forum.</p>
<p>Right click on your bottle in Crossover, and select the <em>install software into&hellip;</em> option from the menu.</p>
<p>Select the first edit button to choose the file that you want to install, and select the file that you just downloaded.</p>
<p>When the patch loads, you will need to identify the executable that you wish yo patch - click the prompt and navigate through C: &gt; Program Files &gt; Championship Manager 01/02, and select the cm0102.exe executable.</p>
<p>You can then customise the updates that you wish to make.  The patch will suggest an update profile, but you may wish to add other features - such as revealing hidden attributes, and applying year specific patches.</p>
<p>Load up CM0102, you will need to create a new save if you have applied naming corrections (and probably wise to anyway.  Look at your amazing Burnley team, and note their presence in the Championship, season start year, and bask in the glory of your teams&rsquo; revealed hidden attributes.</p>
<h3 id="caution">Caution</h3>
<p>Make sure to run weekly autosave in your settings - occasionally the game will stick, often around a penalty.</p>

</ol>
<p>First of all you will need a tactics pack.  I could not get any of the zipped downloads on the champman0102 forum to work on Mac, or inside google drive.  I did find <a href="https://nic.hopto.org/open/cm0102/tactics/UTPv3.zip">this pack</a>, which worked grand.</p>
<p>Open the uncompressed download folder, and select the .tct files inside that you want to use.</p>
<p>In Crossover, right click on your CM0102 bottle, and select &lsquo;Open C: Drive&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The virtual C drive folder will load in finder.  Select &lsquo;Program Files&rsquo; then &lsquo;Championship Manager 01-02&rsquo; then &lsquo;Tactics&rsquo;.  Paste the files you have copied into this folder.</p>
<p>Open up your Championship Manager 01/02 install, and look at your amazing Burnley team, and think about which tactic to use with them.</p>

<p>This is the fourth article in my updated series, walking through how to install and update Championship Manager 01/02 on MacOS with M1/M2 processors using Crossover.  Full series:</p>

</ol>
<p>The CM0102 iso released into freeware by Eidos does not contain the background images (I&rsquo;m pretty sure they are there an my CD-ROM, I just don&rsquo;t have anything with a CD-ROM to test this!), but even if you are playing with the original disc, you will likely want to update the images given the number of stadium moves that have taken place in the interim.</p>
<p>First of all you will need a stadium images pack.  I could not get any of the zipped downloads on the champman0102 forum to work on Mac, or inside google drive.  I did find <a href="https://www.lonebullet.com/file/skins/cm0102-background-pack/3">this pack</a>, which worked fine for me - <strong>though be careful not to click on any of the spurious adverts on this site</strong>.</p>
<p>Open the uncompressed download folder, and copy all of the files inside it.</p>
<p>In Crossover, right click on your CM0102 bottle, and select &lsquo;Open C: Drive&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The virtual C drive folder will load in finder.  Select &lsquo;Program Files&rsquo; then &lsquo;Championship Manager 01-02&rsquo; then &lsquo;Pictures&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Paste all of the files you have copied into this folder select &lsquo;Replace&rsquo; and check &lsquo;Apply to All&rsquo; when prompted to do so - you will need to do this twice, once for the config file, and again for the images.</p>
<p>Open up your Championship Manager 01/02 install, and gaze lovingly at the home of Burnley FC, Turf Moor, &lsquo;Happy Place&rsquo;.</p>

<h2 id="why-bother">Why bother?</h2>
<p>There are two main reasons that you will want to patch your CM01/02 install to 3.9.68.  Firstly - it will fix all of the below problems, most of which I did not notice first time around.  Second, and more importantly, you will need to have patched to 3.9.68 if you want to install any of the data updates that continue to be maintaned even now.</p>

<ul>
<li>Compensation is now paid to players former club for non Bosman 2 transfers</li>
<li>Fixed potential crash when reminders are generated for player notes</li>
<li>Brazilian National First and Second divisions now use playoff stage for history and not league table</li>
<li>Fixed problem with Libertadores Cup picking wrong Brazilian teams sometimes</li>
<li>Three regional Brazilian championships now award prize money if their playoff match is not needed.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3968">3.9.68</h3>
<ul>

</ul>
<h2 id="how">How</h2>

<p>Right click on your bottle in Crossover, and select the <em>install software into&hellip;</em> option from the menu.</p>
<p>Select the first edit button to choose the file that you want to install, and select the file that you just downloaded.</p>
<p>Install the patch, working your way through the couple of dialogues that prompt.</p>

			 <p>How to install Championship Manager 01/02 on M1/M2 powered MacOS machines using Crossover.</p>
<hr>
<p>I&rsquo;ve written a number of guides over the years describing how to install, update and play Championship Manager 01/02 an MacOS <a href="https://lee-perry.co.uk/2017/09/05/how-install-championship.html">1</a> | <a href="https://lee-perry.co.uk/2019/11/25/how-to-install.html">2</a> | <a href="https://lee-perry.co.uk/2019/12/07/how-to-play.html">3</a>, which were quite popular on my macretro project (which I decided to incorporate here instead).</p>
<p>Why would I want to install this? because 01/02 is probably the best version of Championship Manager ever released.  As the last version released prior to the introduction of the top down pitch view, the game play is lean and slick, while comprehensive enough to be challenging.</p>

<p>I cannot get PlayOnMac to function properly, I&rsquo;ll try again, but for now I&rsquo;m using Crossover which has an associated licence fee.  Importantly, I have no affiliation with Crossover, I use their product because it is great and works well.</p>
<p>Firstly head over to <a href="https://www.codeweavers.com">Crossover</a> and download an evaluation copy, which should give you a trial period to test the software out.</p>
<p>If you do not have a copy of the CM0102 iso, you can download it for free as Eidos released the rights to this version.  The iso is available from the <a href="https://www.champman0102.net/viewtopic.php?f=76&amp;t=35">champman0102 forum</a>.</p>
<p>The video below shows the workflow on screen which comprises of:</p>
<ul>
<li>mount your cm0102 iso using DiskImageMounter</li>
<li>install an unlisted application in Crossover</li>
<li>install</li>
<li>name a new windows 7 <strong>32-bit</strong> bottle</li>
<li>select autorun.exe from the mounted iso</li>
<li>follow the CM0102 install screens that load.</li>
<li>do not install directX at the end of the install</li>
</ul>
<p>Making sure that your iso is still mounted (you will be able to see the virtual drive still on your desktop), double click on the CM0102 executable in your bottle.</p>
<p>Happy Championship managering!!!!!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll return shortly to talk about applying updates to the install, and how to update the game data if you wish to do so.</p>

			 <p>The second activity in the Rouvy Welcome Challenge is an introduction to the workouts side of the app.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure which route the workout follows, but looking at the Rouvy Companion App it seemed to be following a chocolate box route above <a href="https://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podu_D%C3%A2mbovi%C8%9Bei,_Arge%C8%99">Podu Dâmboviței</a> in Romania.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The activity follows the <a href="https://my.rouvy.com/workouts/detail/508531">My first ROUVY workout</a> activity.  The workout consists of a warm up and warn down, and 3 blocks of 65%/85%/100% FTP intervals.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure workouts worked quite as I expected, and I need to research more:</p>
<ul>
<li>The activity did not sync mapping through to Strava.</li>
<li>The consistency of speed across the intervals would suggest that the data made no account of gradient and ascent in calculating distance.</li>
<li>I understood that you could choose the video, I expect that you probably can outwith this welcome challenge.</li>
</ul>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The ERG mode worked really well and felt fantastic, so I&rsquo;ll be interested to test this functionality more to see if the same points occur on manually selected workouts.</p>

<p>Optimising the Hugo title tag in micro.blog for better SEO.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have developed my micro.blog hosted Hugo website <a href="https://lee-perry.co.uk/2023/01/31/taking-ownership-of.html">to replace existing social media channels</a> with a single site.</p>
<p>It holds <a href="https://lee-perry.co.uk/categories/snips/">snips</a> that largely replicate the thoughts and conversation that many years ago I might have made on Twitter, and also <a href="https://lee-perry.co.uk/photos/">shots</a> that contains image posts that more recently I might have placed on Instagram.  All of my long form <a href="https://lee-perry.co.uk/categories/articles/">articles</a> are housed on this site too - everything under one roof.</p>
<p>For the most part the experience has been great, and I can see how that could be made even better by learning more Hugo - though thats not really the purpose of this site.</p>
<p>The one aspect of the experience that has either stayed the same, or feels like it has worsened is traffic.  Traffic is not a primary concern for me - but I&rsquo;d like at least some people to read what I write.</p>
<p>So I have been trying to improve the SEO of the site.  There is only so much of that which can be templated - and ensuring all content has a title tag is one area.  As author I need to also make sure that the titles, descriptions, and articles are also well drafted for SEO in writing as you cannot customise the Hugo frontmatter on micro.blog in the way that you might on a self hosted Hugo site.</p>
<p>Attached code creates different structured title tags based on whether the page is the homepage or not, and whether the page has a title or not.  Its not perfect, and means that pages without titles will have a title identical to the start of the description - but better and more readable in search engines than nothing at all.</p>
<p>As always, Hugo strips out the Go templating language on publication, so sadly embedding as an image.</p>
<p>Place this code or any variant above over the top of the existing title tag in your theme - in the theme that my custom theme is built on, that is in head.html.</p>
<p>My view statistics are heavily polluted/inflated at the moment as I have been doing so much development live on the site, but I can see that most of the traffic is me.  I&rsquo;ll look back in a couple of months to see how traffic evolves, before deciding whether or not to bring my remaining <a href="https://macretro.co.uk">macretro</a> project across (which receives much more traffic).</p>

			 <p>Today&rsquo;s ride took in the 18km <em>Lindknud South Area Clockwise</em> route by Nick Holme Kjeldsen on <a href="https://lee-perry.co.uk/lists/fulgaz-rides">Fulgaz</a>. 🚲</p>
<p>Having been down in London this week, this was my first ride back after suffering from London germs.  As such I took it pretty easily, riding at about 50% of my threshold.  It did not feel too bad</p>
<p>The scenery is made up of green fields, blue skies, and yellow rape.  The picture is crisp and clear throughout.</p>
<p>The ride profile is flat, climbing and dropping only slightly.  Riding on Fulgaz the resistance is constantly changing, though smooth and well-synched to the video.</p>
<p>The video is great, and a good length for a lunchtime TT or FTP test - or post-illness recovery ride!</p>

			 <p>The combination of high quality videos and gamification would probably make Rouvy my favourite virtual cycling platform.</p>
<p>The videos are not as strong as Fulgaz, and the interest factor not as strong as Zwift, but there has been one factor stopping me using Rouvy for about two years now - vibrating videos.   Rouvy probably has the strongest all-round combination though.</p>
<p>Whatever platform I have used - MacOs, iPadOS, and a quick ugh, windows, shudders, attempt have all resulted in the sort of vibrating video that would quickly make me travel sick.  The other bar to entry for me was the 100% realism, which though laudible was not really workable with a very highly geared Wattbike Atom - though the subsequent introduction of virtual gearing has resolved that.</p>
<p>I was so impressed with my wee ARM powered Chromebook that I decided to buy a properly powered one, and have been working through setting up a Chromebook as an easy optimized Linux laptop - <a href="https://lee-perry.co.uk/categories/chromebook/">project here</a>.  So I decided to put Rouvy on to see how it works on a Chromebook.</p>
<p>I was surprised, the videos look amazing, and the AR overlay looks really good too - far better than it does on either my iMac, or MacBook Air.  All of the graphical artefacts looked far sharper too.</p>
<p>The downside, is that all of the UI on the front pages is screwed, and the menu pages are not functioning at all.  Presumably as the screen is rendering for tablet.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve not tried to ride yet, so have no idea for example how many concurrent bluetooth connections can be held, though suspect that will probably all be grand.</p>
<p>I have completed a back to metal rebuild of my M1 Macbook Air in the last week, since replacing the screen  - so I&rsquo;ll try Rouvy again there but expect the video vibration and dodgy graphical overlays will still persist as they do on iPad :(.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>In this article I run through how to setup Git and Github ready for developing on a Chromebook. This article is the third in a series of articles about doing geeky things with <a href="https://lee-perry.co.uk/categorihttps://micro.blog/post#es/chromebook/">Chromebooks</a> - from software development to retro gaming.</p>
<p>Setting up Git and Github ready for development are pretty simple, but amongst the most important setup tasks that you will complete on any machine.  Doing so enables you to version control your code, and to pull code from and push code back to your remote repository (in this case Github, though there are alternatives).  Really I expected there to be nuances, but in reality this workflow is identical to the process on the various Linux distributions or on MacOS.</p>
<p>Remember from the first article in this series, the Chromebook already had Git installed when when turned on the Linux development environment.  The first thing that I will do is to configure the Git user in the terminal.</p>
<p><code>git config --global user.name &quot;Your Name&quot;</code> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<code>git config --global user.email &quot;your@email.address&quot;</code></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I want to be able to push code to my github repositories and pull code back, so I need to generate an ssh key.  To do that:</p>
<p><code>ssh-keygen -t  ed25519 -C &quot;your@email.address&quot;</code></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m happy to use the default storage location, and I do not want to use a passcode with the key, so I just click return through the next three prompts.  The key is generated, and pictographic representation printed.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Next I turn on ssh-agent, and add the key to it.</p>
<p><code>eval &quot;$(ssh-agent -s)&quot;</code> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<code>ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519</code></p>
<p>If you opted for a different key identifier, you will need to remember to change the key idea in this code also.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I also need to add the ssh key to my Github account - so I concatenate the key to terminal ready for copying and pasting later.</p>
<p><code>cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub</code></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Now in my Github account I navigate through to my account settings, scrolling through to the access section.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Heading into the SSH and GPG keys section, I click on the green button to add a new SSH key.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Here I paste in the concatenated SSH key that I copied earlier, clicking the &lsquo;Add SSH Key&quot; button that will appear below the key box in the screenshot below.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Finally, having added the SSH key to Github, I finish up for the night by testing that it works:</p>
<p><code>ssh -T git@github.com</code></p>
<p>If the key has installed correctly, the same text as below should appear, stating that you have successfully authenticated, but Github does not provide shell access.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>A simple and straightforward walkthrough that is essentially identical on Chromebook to the process on other machines.  Stay tuned to see what I setup on Chromebook next, and if there is anything that you would like me to try to get working, raise it in the discussion section below.</p>

<p>There are a couple of things that you should check before you begin.  If you have read my earlier article, you will have noted that buying an intel rather than arm based Chromebook is important for versatility.
Run <code>dpkg --print-architecture</code> in the penguin Linux terminal to find out - hopefully the answer will be amd as below.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Next, my Chromebook came with python and git already installed - run <code>git --version</code> and <code>python3 --version</code> in the penguin terminal to check that both are installed.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>There are a couple of tasks that we need to carry out to prepare the environment.  First run <code>sudo apt-get update</code> to update the apt-get package library on the machine.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Then run <code>sudo apt-get install -y gnome-keyring</code> to install the gnome keyring package, which will help to work with secure data.

<p>At this point you should be ready to get started.  Head over to <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download">code.virtualstudio.com</a>, and download the correct Debian executable for your Chromebook - x64 if you do have an intel/amd chip.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Double click on the executable that you have downloaded, and the install modal should load.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>If the installation completes successfully, you should now be able to see Virtual Studio Code on the find menu.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Double click on the virtual studio code application, and you will now be at the main control screen.  If you have bought a lower powered or arm chipped Chromebook, this may take a little longer to load.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Next you need to prepare the installation ready for use.  First install the linter for the languages you wish to use.  Shortly I will run a brief python script, so I install the python linter from the extensions menu.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>None of the key strokes within virtual studio code will be working properly.  So (in your chrome browser) head over to <a href="chrome://flags">chrome://flags</a> and turn on the deprecate alt-based six pack extension, this will release the keys that will otherwise be reserved for chrome.</p>
<p>My screenshot button will still not work - instead click control+shift+find windows buttons simultaneously, and the screenshot functionality will open.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Finally I run a wee hello world script to say hello to the world.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>At this point I have a simple development machine setup on my Chromebook, and hopefully so have you.  Stay tuned to see what I make my Chromebook do next - I&rsquo;ll probably look to work out how to generate SSH keys, and link to my github account.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>My Chromebook series follows my experiment using a Chromebook as a Linux based software development and retro gaming laptop.  This article walks through setting up the Linux development environment on Chromebook.</p>
<h2 id="first-of-all-though-why">First of all though, why?</h2>
<p>There are a number of reasons that I wanted to do this project.</p>
<p>First of all, not being on Windows is not one of those reasons.  I have to use Windows based environments most of the time when working for my employers, but otherwise have barely touched Windows in a decade.  I became so tired of maintaining ever sluggish machines and keeping malware at bay that not only did I remove it from my own hardware, I took the Wombles on a Linux Mint journey too.</p>
<p>That worked really well for the Wombles for about a decade, running Linux Mint on an old tower PC unit.  No viruses, no slowdown, no need to clean up and defragment their HDD every time we went to see them in Spain.  Until last year when the hardware finally failed.  Wanting them to stay on a low maintenance low risk setup, I&rsquo;d been planning to transition them onto a Chromebook for a while, which increasingly made sense given their Android adoption in the intervening period.</p>
<p>The main problem was, that I needed to be able to train them to use a Chromebook, and given that my own technology stack for most of the last decade had revolved around all things Apple, I&rsquo;d never used them.  So we bought a wee Chromebook for the wombles to use - their use case revolves entirely around Chrome anyway, and another for ourselves so that we could train them on how to set it up from afar in Burnley, in the UK.  Thankfully, most Chromebooks are as cheap as chips - the technology requirements for a computer that in many ways is based upon mobile and tablet architecture are not too taxing.</p>
<p>I was quite impressed with my little Lenovo Ideapad.  It was not a high spec, and though that showed it has been fantastic for doing all things browser based whether in the lounge or sat on a train.  I particularly enjoyed the quiet that came with not being on my M1 MacBook Air, which though excellent, is very well connected to the world.  So I saw the virtue in using a Chromebook to work online in a more offline manner.  I&rsquo;d also used the Linux developer mode to set up a basic development environment.  It worked, but I could not install everything that I wanted to - in part due to power and memory, and in part because I had chosen a model with an ARM chip structure rather than x86 (Intel).</p>
<p>Finally, my MacBook Air died last week after just 15 months.  Though it has been subsequently rejuvenated through a screen replacement (for a third of the cost at the genius bar), I had decided that I would not replace, and would instead experiment with a higher specification Chromebook, primarily using the Debian based Linux development environment.</p>
<h2 id="which-chromebook">Which Chromebook?</h2>
<p>So I opted for an Acer Chromebook 515.  It has a 256GB SSD drive, 8GB RAM generous 16&quot; screen and an 11th generation Intel i5 chip - positively overkill for a Chromebook.  Not everything I try to do will necessarily work, but this series of articles will walk through my attempts to setup my development environment, and more ambitiously to use it up as a retro-gaming machine.  Between gift cards and promo vouchers, this machine actually only set me back about £300/€350/$400.</p>
<p>If you are following along, and read the rest of the articles in the <a href="https://lee-perry.co.uk/categories/chromebook/">Chromebook</a> category to make sure that I succeeded, you probably want to buy a Chromebook with a modern i or m series chip of a recent generation for the best chance of success.</p>
<h2 id="step-by-step-setup">Step by Step setup</h2>
<p>So without further ado, lets begin.</p>
<p>First of all open the settings application on the Chromebook.  Scroll down to the &lsquo;&lt; &gt; Developers&rsquo; section towards the bottom of the left hand menu.  Once there, if you have a recent Chromebook compatible with the Linux Development Environment, you shouild see an option to turn this on.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Click &lsquo;Next to proceed&rsquo;:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Having turned on the development environment, choose your username for the Linux environment and the size of the disk that you will allocate to it.  You can change this up and down later, but here I&rsquo;m leaving 64GB for the Chromebook, and giving the remainder to the Linux environment - that is predominantly what I am intending to use most on this machine.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Finally, open up the Linux &lsquo;Terminal&rsquo; application.  That will open up the Penguin Command Line Interface that you will use to control the linux environment.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>run a quick &lsquo;python &ndash;version&rsquo; in Penguin, and you will see the version of Python installed on the machine.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll leave it there for this article, but check out the articles that follow in the <a href="https://lee-perry.co.uk/categories/chromebook/">Chromebook</a> to see how I got on!</p>

			 <p>Todays ride took in the 18km <em>Fiesta Island</em> route by Mike Nelson on <a href="https://lee-perry.co.uk/categories/fulgaz">Fulgaz</a>. 🚲</p>
<p>The scenery is a combination of tidal San Diego River, Californian marshland, and deep blue skies.  Especially liked the bridge at 1.6km in.</p>
<p>The ride profile is flat, climbing and dropping only to clear bridges.  Riding on fulgaz the resistance is constantly changing, though smooth and well synched to the video.</p>
<p>Unusually you will likely complete this faster than the ride author, making for some comedy movements when passing runners and walkers on the road.</p>
<p>The video is just fantastic, scenery superb, and a good length for a lunchtime TT or FTP test.  I&rsquo;ve given 5/5.</p>

			 <p>Todays ride took in the 13km <em>Arguineguin to Meloneras Loop</em> route by Walter Muller on <a href="https://lee-perry.co.uk/categories/fulgaz">Fulgaz</a>. 🚲</p>
<p>This ride is a typical Canarian scene, blue sky, with a deep blue sea and sandy hills.  Riding out from Arguineguin towards Maspalomas, you drop down to sea level at Meloneras before swinging through 180º to reverse tracks to the start.</p>

<p>The ride profile is rolling, climbing and descending but rarely flat.  Riding o fulgaz the resistance is constantly changing - though those micro adjustments are much more smoothed than the less frequent gear changes needed on Kinomap..</p>
<p>The video is just fantastic after a few months riding on other apps, the 4K picture is pixel perfect, scenery superb, and a good length for a lunchtime TT or FTP test.  I&rsquo;ve given 5/5.  Nice ride, but not blown away - maybe I&rsquo;ve been spoiled this week.</p>

			 <p>Todays ride took in the 20 km <em>Dénia to Sagra</em> route by Toumy Degham on <a href="https://lee-perry.co.uk/categories/kinomap">Kinomap</a>. 🚲</p>
<p>This ride is a typical Spanish ride from costa to campo.  The views are dominated by the green hills on the horizon, and the various fincas that you pass.  Despite the start along the beach, you barely see it.</p>
<p>The first third of the ride is flat, climbing slowly thereafter to the village of Sagra, nothing too steep, very rideable, and generally well matched to the video with little pulsing.</p>
<p>Good video, excellent clarity in picture, good scenery, and a good length for a lunchtime TT or FTP test.  I&rsquo;ve given 4/5.  Nice ride, but not blown away - maybe I&rsquo;ve been spoiled this week.</p>

			 <p>Workflow and templates follow for a small, routed, multi-page flask app - for MacOS / Linux based systems only.</p>
<p>First of all we need to set up the folder structure ready to host the project, setup and activate the python virtual environment, and install flask.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>mkdir flask_demo
cd flask_demo
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install flask
-m pip install --upgrade pip
pip list

Package            		Version
-------------------------------------
click				8.1.3
Flask 				2.2.3
importlib-metadata  		6.0.0
itsdangerous             	2.1.2
Jinja2                         	3.1.2
MarkupSafe              	2.1.2
pip                            	23.0.1
setuptools               	49.2.1
Werkzeug                  	2.2.3
zipp                           	3.15.0
</code></pre><p>Next we create the main program file in the root folder - in this case I have called it demo.py.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>touch demo.py
</code></pre><h2 id="demopy">demo.py</h2>
<p>demo.py is a very simple file that imports app from the program folder.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>from program import app
</code></pre><p>Next we create the program subfolder, and create two files within it.  __ init __.py and routes.py.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>mkdir program
cd program
touch __init__.py
touch routes.py
</code></pre><h2 id="__-init-__py">__ init __.py</h2>
<p>__ init __.py is the main application.  Here we import Flask, assigns itself within Flask to the app variable we called into the main program, and also imports routes.py</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

from program import routes
</code></pre><h2 id="routespy">routes.py</h2>
<p>routes.py starts off by identifying the routes or addresses within the application.</p>
<p>routes.py also imports the render_template module und uses it to render any html templates that have been stipulated against each route, rather than stipulating output directly here.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>from program import app
from flask import render_template

@app.route(&#39;/&#39;)
@app.route(&#39;/index&#39;)

def index():
	return render_template(&#39;index.html&#39;)

@app.route(&#39;/about&#39;)
def about():
	return render_template(&#39;about.html&#39;)

@app.route(&#39;/occupancy_calculator&#39;)
def work():
	return render_template(&#39;occupancy_calculator.html&#39;)
</code></pre><p>Finally we create a templates subdirectory within the program folder, and we create our template files within it.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>mkdir templates
cd templates
touch base.html
touch index.html
</code></pre><h2 id="basehtml">base.html</h2>
<p>We create base.html - we sets out the main html page structure that the app will use.  Note the jinja templating inside the curly brackets, calling in the content of linked templates.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
      &lt;meta charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;
      &lt;meta http-equiv=&#34;X-UA-Compatible&#34; content=&#34;IE=edge&#34;&gt;
      &lt;meta name=&#34;viewport&#34; content=&#34;width=device-width, initial-scale=1&#34;&gt;
      &lt;!-- load MUI --&gt;
      &lt;link href=&#34;//cdn.muicss.com/mui-0.9.39/css/mui.min.css&#34; rel=&#34;stylesheet&#34; type=&#34;text/css&#34; /&gt;
      &lt;script src=&#34;//cdn.muicss.com/mui-0.9.39/js/mui.min.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;div class=&#34;mui-panel&#34;&gt;Menu Bar - 
            &lt;button class=&#34;mui-btn mui-btn--raised&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;/index&#34;&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/button&gt;
            &lt;button class=&#34;mui-btn mui-btn--raised&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;/100Days&#34;&gt;100 Days&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/button&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;hr&gt;
        {% block content %}{% endblock %}
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre><h2 id="indexhtml">index.html</h2>
<p>Then we create all of the other page templates - note the jinja templating again, first declaring the extension of the base template, declaring the block content, and then defining the content.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>{% extends &#34;base.html&#34; %}

{% block content%}
		&lt;h1&gt;Hello!&lt;/h1&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;This is the text we&#39;ve included in our HTML files&lt;/p&gt;

{% endblock%}
</code></pre><p>Finally, we return to the route folder, and run flask.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>cd ..
cd ..
flask run
</code></pre><p>One extra thing that we can do is to install the python-dotenv, defining the app within the environment to speed up each launch.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>pip install python-dotenv
touch .flaskenv
env | grep FLASK_APP
flask run
</code></pre>

			 <p>Todays ride took in the 12 km <em>San Vittore Roveredo Carasole</em> route by SilvanoTurati on <a href="https://lee-perry.co.uk/categories/kinomap">Kinomap</a>. 🚲</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really have words for the scenery, its just phenomenal.  Deep blue skies, lush green valleys, tall surrounding peaks with the river Moësa for company in parts.  This ride really is something else.</p>
<p>The first 10km of the ride are largely flat, rolling through a couple of climbs as the ride makes its way from San Vittore and through Roveredo.  After the detour through Roveredo the ride drops back to the river, before almost 2km of climb at 10% to the Chiesa San Rocco in the village of Carasole.</p>
<p>The gradient profile is very rideable, it doesn&rsquo;t match the video exactly - but thankfully is not as terraced as my last ride.  For a perfectly matched gradient profile, you do really need to ride on Fulgaz.</p>
<p>Superb smooth video, excellent clarity in picture, great scenery, and a good length for a lunchtime TT or FTP test.  I&rsquo;ve given 5/5 - one of the best rides I have done on Kinomap.</p>

			 <p>Todays ride took in the 24 km <em>Maryborough 3 Reservoir Loop - Part 1</em> route by RobbieRensenbrink on <a href="https://lee-perry.co.uk/categories/kinomap">Kinomap</a>. 🚲</p>
<p>The scenery is a beautiful mix of yellow grain and blue sky, interspersed with occasion herds of cattle.  There is also a lovely scan of Maryborough&rsquo;s sandstone train station right at the very beginning of the ride.</p>
<p>The profile is rolling with 200m of climb.  Depending on the power you put down, this route should take you around 45 minutes.  The gradient profile is definitely out of sync in places.  I suspect that this is the first ride I have done where have noticed the more frequent gradient changes in Kinomap.  However, this results in a bizarre sequence of steps and plateaus that does not really reflect the video.  I know that you cannot pleas eall of the people all of the time, but I think I prefer either the hyper smoothed approach that you usually get on Kinomap or the constantly changing gradient of Fulgaz.  I&rsquo;m not sure I like this middle ground compromise very much.</p>
<p>The video is superb, great scenery, smooth though filmed from a faster vehicle, and a good length for a lunchtime TT or FTP test.  I&rsquo;ve given 4/5 - it would have been 5/5 but for the slightly weird gradient profile.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://lee-perry.co.uk/2023/02/25/alcohol-and-substance.html">Drug and Alcohol Management in the Workplace - The Law and Enforcement</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://lee-perry.co.uk/2023/02/25/alcohol-and-substance.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2023-02-25 12:48:20 &#43;0000">Feb 25, 2023</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Alcohol and substance abuse is a sensitive area which can and does impact on the ability of employees to perform not only safety critical tasks, but also their core duties well.  This article looks at the legislative basis for drug and alcohol management policies and testing regimes in the workplace, from a health and safety point of view.</p>
<p>Like other people management topics as stress there is a confluence of interests in this area with the Human Resources or Human Capital Management function.  Similar to those other topics, this issue is not solely about what happens in the workplace either - with behaviour being influenced by a whole range of factors outwith the workplace that employers have only visibility of.</p>
<h2 id="the-law">The Law</h2>
<p>Firstly it is important to be clear that there is nothing written directly in Health &amp; Safety legislation on the topic of drug and alcohol management in the workplace.  This topic is not unique in that, and while this section will look at the legislation in this area from a health and safety point of view, there will often be direct statutory offences under other (ie road traffic / misuse of drugs) legislation with more relevant regulators.  That principle is important for the sections that follow.</p>
<p>Though there is no specific health and safety legislation on this topic, there is plenty of general legislation that does apply including:</p>
<ul>
<li>the general duties towards employees and others who may be affected by the undertaking in Sections 2 and 3 of the Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974.</li>
<li>to set out the health and safety policy and arrangements under Section 2 of the same.</li>
<li>the requirements to carry out risk assessments, and to make arrangements to implement their findings under the Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999.</li>
<li>it is also worth pointing out that employees also have a duty, to a standard of reasonableness, to take care of the health and safety of themselves and others, and to co-operate with the employer - the latter being especially important when looking to implement drug and alcohol policies in the workplace.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="section-3-policy">Section 3 Policy</h2>
<p>Section 3 of the Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974 is worded as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(1)It shall be the duty of every employer to conduct his undertaking in such a way as to ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, that persons not in his employment who may be affected thereby are not thereby exposed to risks to their health or safety.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of the challenges for the Health and Safety Executive is that Section 3 can be read so broadly as to extend to almost anything.  It could be interpreted for example as extending to road traffic accidents and medical negligence, for example.</p>
<h2 id="enforcement">Enforcement</h2>
<p>For this reason HSE publishes its <a href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/enforce/opalert.htm">policy statement</a> on Section 3, setting out where it will focus its efforts.  In practical terms this means that where more relevant regulators exist, HSE will leave enforcement to that regulator, providing technical expertise where necessary to support, or perhaps investigation health and safety breaches in parallel (with corporate manslaughter, for example).</p>
<p>This means that HSE would only exceptionally become involved in road traffic accident investigations, leaving the police to lead on the investigation and enforcement.  This is significant of course, as statistically road traffic accidents are both a significant source of workplace accidents in this country, and also a topic where drug and alcohol impairment is incredibly important.</p>
<p>That is not to say that drug and alcohol impairment is not important to HSE, clearly drug and alcohol impairment in safety critical applications is a significant risk factor.  Where impairment was a factor in industrial accidents HSE would need to consider the dutyholder’s approach to drug and alcohol management in their investigation.</p>
<h2 id="guidance">Guidance</h2>
<p>With that in mind HSE publishes <a href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/alcoholdrugs/">guidance</a> for dutyholders on the management of drug and alcohol misuse in the workplace that is centred around:</p>
<ul>
<li>consultation with employees on arrangements</li>
<li><strong>focussing on safety critical work</strong></li>
<li>setting out the arrangements within the health and safety policy</li>
<li>being clear about what you may wish to achieve from screening and testing</li>
<li>supporting people with drug and alcohol problems.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="scope-creep">Scope Creep</h2>
<p>One of the key challenges for practitioners revolves back to HSE’s point about being clear about what you wish to achieve on this topic.  Drug and alcohol screening detects not only impairment, but use, and often use that has nothing to do with the workplace, and that may even be prescribed.</p>
<p>So as health and safety practitioners we should be making sure that our drug and alcohol policies are proportionate to and focus on risk.  The organisations that we work for may want more expansive drug and alcohol screening programs to identify use more widely, of a broader cohort of substances.  There may be good performance reasons for that - but they have little to do with proportionate risk-based health and safety management.</p>
<h2 id="coming-up">Coming up</h2>
<p>I will return to this topic in a later article(s) to talk about implementation of drug and alcohol testing policies, and will propose that, done properly, drug and alcohol testing policies are not purely a reactive measure after the horse has bolted, but can contribute to the development of a healthy and positive health and safety culture.</p>

			 <p>Todays ride took in the 19 km <em>Gran Canaria / Maspalomas To Puerto Rico</em> route by Black Forest Cycling on <a href="https://lee-perry.co.uk/categories/kinomap">Kinomap</a>. 🚲</p>
<p>The scenery is superb typical canarian, with deep blue skies contrasting against deeper blue ocean and rolling sand hills.</p>
<p>The profile is rolling with 211m of climb.  Depending on the power you put down, this route should take you under 40 minutes.  The gradient profile sis definitely out of sync in places, with climbs arriving slightly ahead of the video and vice-versa.</p>
<p>This ride is a longer version of the <a href="https://lee-perry.co.uk/2023/02/22/gran-canaria-playa.html">Gran Canaria / Playa del Ingles to El Pajar</a> route I rode from yesterday, starting slightly nearer to Maspalomas than Playa del Ingles, but carrying on through to Puerto Rico de Gran Canaria.</p>
<p>The video is great overall again, great scenery, smooth with no pulsing, and a good length for a lunchtime TT or FTP test.  I&rsquo;ve given 4/5.  These Black Forest Cycling rides seem to maintain a rider i the foreground - I like the perspective that gives, but not all virtual cyclists do.</p>

<p>Possibly one of the most perfect videos that I&rsquo;ve ridden on Kinomap.</p>
<p>The scenery is superb, with deep blue skies contrasting against the deep red sandstone cliffs, with the Colorado River meandering alongside.</p>
<p>The profile is pretty much flat and depending on the power you put down, this route should take you around 30 minutes.  Not completely convinced by the accuracy of the elevation profile, which continues to run gently downhill, despite the 180° turn at the mid point.</p>
<p>The video is near perfect though, amazing scenery, well timed with no pulsing, and a good length for a lunchtime TT or FTP test.  I&rsquo;ve given 5/5.</p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I need to ride on Kinomap more, given that I have a lifetime membership.  While the app is very good, there are a couple of little niggles that frustrate me, sending me into <a href="https://lee-perry.co.uk/categories/fulgaz">Fulgaz</a> or <a href="https://lee-perry.co.uk/categories/bigringvr">BigRingVR</a> exile every now and again.  I&rsquo;ll probably talk about that in a future post.</p>
<p>I really enjoyed this ride.  I used to live in Fife until 2014, and this ride took me right back there, I used to ride a little part of this circuit back then too.</p>
<p>The scenery is great, highlights being the view of the Wallace Monument on the way out of Stirling, over the Clackmannanshire Bridge, and across the canal to the Kelpies at the end.  As Scotland goes the weather is pretty good.  The profile is broadly rolling, and depending on the power you put down, this route should take you 1h30 - 2h.  I did this ride in two halves, dissected by canine naughtiness.</p>
<p>The sky is a little bleached, there is a little pulsing in the video feed, and there is a little more movement than in more recent videos - but a really good ride, surrounded by great scenery - I&rsquo;ve given 4/5.</p>

			 <p>Understanding the stay put or defend-in-place evacuation strategy is crucial to understanding fire safety in purpose built blocks of flats in the UK.  This post explains, what a defend in place evacuation strategy is, what is necessary for the strategy to work, and the circumstances in which a change in strategy <em>might</em> be necessary.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h2 id="defend-in-place">Defend in Place</h2>
<p>Defend in place has been a central component of the design of apartment blocks since the post-war reconstruction era.  The concept is quite simple, buildings are designed so that each compartment, or residential unit is designed to contain a fire within the compartment of origin, and thereby away from the means of escape and other residential units for at least 30 minutes.  The residential units are provided with individual detection and alarm systems, the common areas of the building are not.  In the event of a fire, the occupants in the compartment or apartment of original evacuate the building, closing the doors behind them, raise the alarm, and the fire and rescue service attend, extinguishing the fire before it can reach other parts of the building or compromise the means of escape.</p>
<h2 id="why-defend-in-place">Why Defend in Place?</h2>
<p>So thats the theory behind defend in place, but what is the rationale behind it? The answer is really quite simple, and lies in the design of the buildings themselves.  The dominance of single stair core designs for apartment blocks or blocks of flats in the UK presents a conflict in the event of fire between the need for firefighters to scale the staircase with their equipment, and for residents to evacuation down it.  A defend-in place strategy resolves that conflict by holding residents unaffected by fire in their apartments, and reserving the staircase primarily for firefighters to reach the areas of the building affected by fire.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-needed-for-a-defend-in-place-strategy-to-work">What is needed for a defend in place strategy to work?</h2>
<p>For a defend in place evacuation strategy to work, the <a href="https://safetyfactor.co.uk/2023/02/07/what-is-compartmentation.html">compartmentation</a> to the building needs to be adequate.  There are two components to that - the compartmentation needs to be adequately maintained, and resident behaviour conducive, to prevent the spread of heat, fire and smoke earlier than intended.</p>
<h3 id="compartmentation">Compartmentation</h3>
<p>My earlier article on <a href="https://safetyfactor.co.uk/2023/02/07/what-is-compartmentation.html">compartmentation</a> covered off what compartmentation is, and how the compartmentation to a building can be compromised through the life of a building.  So we will not cover that ground here other than reminding of the need for service penetrations to be appropriately fire-stopped by competent contractors when works take place, and that effective periodic inspection regimes for the passive protection, fire stopping and fire doors within a building should ensure that compartmentation should remain adequate to support a defend in place strategy.</p>
<h3 id="external-wall-systems">External Wall Systems</h3>
<p>Another way in which the compartmentation to the building can be compromised, rendering the defend in place strategy ineffective, is where an external wall system has been fitted to the exterior of the building.  If materials with the wall system are combustible, and can be ignited from sources of heat within the apartment, then fire may reach other compartments sooner than anticipated through the external wall system and window apertures.  The fires at Grenfell Tower, and before that Lakanal House show this in practice.</p>
<h3 id="human-behaviour">Human Behaviour</h3>
<p>A building can have the best compartmentation in the world, but human behaviour can override it too.  The defend in place strategy depends upon retaining fire in the compartment of original, and maintaining the escape stair clear of heat and smoke.</p>
<p>Resident behaviour can impact the effectiveness of the compartmentation strategy in a couple of ways:</p>
<h4 id="fire-doors">Fire Doors</h4>
<p>Fire doors need to be maintained effectively self closing at all times.  In some scenarios doors may be held open on automatic release devices, though that is unlikely in a building with a defend in place evacuation strategy - where these buildings have common detection systems they are usually only used to activate ventilation systems to the means of escape.  So holding open fire doors is significant in two ways.  First, it damages doors and self-closers impacting the efficacy of the doors in the event of fire.  Second - fire doors wedged open at the time of fire may allow fire heat and smoke to penetrate the means of escape far earlier than intended - hindering firefighting, and reducing the window for evacuation.</p>
<h4 id="evacuation">Evacuation</h4>
<p>The same principles apply to the apartment front doors.  Where self closers have been removed, doors will remain open unless manually closed, and closing front doors in evacuating buildings is the least of the residents&rsquo; worries.  So ensuring that the door furniture is maintained, and that doors will self-close automatically in the event of evacuation is again important to ensuring the ongoing viability of the means of escape.</p>
<h2 id="change-to-simultaneous-evacuation">Change to Simultaneous Evacuation</h2>
<p>Occasionally a building will need to transition on a temporary or permanent basis to a simultaneous evacuation strategy because it has been shown that the compartmentation is inadequate to support the defend in place strategy.</p>
<p>This has been a fairly common transition for many high rise accommodation blocks fitted with external wall systems found to contain combustible materials that could support the spread of fire.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll cover simultaneous evacuation in a separate article, though a simultaneous evacuation strategy has prerequisites that buildings designed for defend-in-place do not.  In particular simultaneous evacuation requires early detection of fire and warning <em>to other residents</em>.</p>
<p>The National Fire Chiefs Council produced the guidance document <a href="https://www.nationalfirechiefs.org.uk/write/MediaUploads/NFCC%20Guidance%20publications/Protection/Simultaneous%20evacutation/SEG_-_4th_Edition_-_FINAL_17082022.pdf">Guidance to support a temporary change to a simultaneous evacuation strategy in purpose-built blocks of flats</a> to provide guidance to dutyholders in making the switch.</p>
<p>Given the absence of warning and detection systems, a <em>waking watch</em> is likely necessary to provide early detection and warning in the first instance.  We&rsquo;ll talk about waking watch more in a subsequent article, but a waking watch consists of the manual patrol and surveillance of a building looking for the early signs of fire.  Its far from ideal or perfect, and very expensive.  For that reason the guidance recommends the installation of temporary or wireless detection and warning systems where the switch is likely to be for a prolonged period.</p>

			 <p>We headed down to Liverpool for the RunThrough Run Aintree event.</p>
<p>RunThrough run the <a href="https://www.runaintree.com">Run Aintree</a> event five times per year, with entry into the half-marathon costing £40 (2023) including event t-shirt.</p>
<p>The event itself is well run, and based within the stadium, it was incredibly nice to use permanent facilities, and not to have to use portaloos!  There was also an excellent though expensive coffee van, and spectators could just sit in the stands and watch their horses run around the course.</p>
<p>The half marathon consists of a 1 km dog-leg along the stands at the beginning of the race, followed by 4 laps of the course, which consists of a lap of the racecourse, and of an inner loop - all very obvious and straightforward.</p>
<p>I started slowly, my plan really was to sit in Z2, and hold on.  Thats pretty much what happened too, building steadily on a long and hilly Padiham circuit from the weekend before.  A slow start, with early toilet stop, after which most splits sat between 5:15/km and 5:35/km.</p>
<p>Run felt good throughout, other than left VMO tightening in last 2 km, before a fast finish.  I didn&rsquo;t push anywhere near as hard as at Fleetwood in the summer - so I was really please to come in marginally faster (though it was cooler).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/craftedbypanda/">Vickie</a> was out running today too, so it was nice to see here a couple of times heading through.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Compartmentation or compartmentalisation are concepts that are crucial to building fire safety in the United Kingdom, but which are routinely undermined and misunderstood by those engaged in installing systems and maintaining buildings.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-compartmentation">What is compartmentation?</h2>
<p>Simply put, compartmentation is the process of dividing a building into compartments that are independent of one other.</p>
<h2 id="why-is-compartmentation-important">Why is compartmentation important?</h2>
<p>Compartmentation in buildings is an important concept in fire safety.  If the building is constructed, maintained and used correctly, a fire should be contained within the compartment of origin for the period it was intended to be.  This should ensure that the means of escape remain viable for a period of time, or provide the assurance needed behind any &lsquo;stay put&rsquo; or phased evacuation strategies.  More on those another time.</p>
<p>When fire, heat, smoke and the products of combustion are able to escape the compartment of origin sooner than intended, the viability of the means of escape and other compartments in the building may be threatened sooner - with implications for the successful evacuation of the building.</p>
<h2 id="how-is-compartmentation-defeated">How is compartmentation defeated?</h2>
<p>To be usable within buildings, compartments need to be penetrated in a number of ways - these penetrations present weaknesses within the building that, if not properly controlled, may allow fire to spread to adjacent compartments.</p>
<h6 id="fire-doors">Fire doors</h6>
<p>It is necessary to move between compartments through door apertures.  To prevent smoke, heat and fire spreading between compartments fire resisting doorsets are used, the doorsets will be fire rated to a period of resistance.  To ensure that the doorset performs to that rating it is important that the doorsets are fitted correctly, and inspected regularly to identify deterioration in condition.</p>
<p>It does not matter how good a fire door is though - it will not act as a fire door if it is wedged open, and doing so will damage the door fit and door furniture.  Where there are genuine operational reasons to hold doors open, then using hold open devices interfaced to the detection and warning system, and checking their function regularly, is much more effective.</p>
<h6 id="service-penetrations">Service Penetrations</h6>
<p>Even in new buildings, services need to pass between compartments.  Examples include electrical circuitry, air movement systems, IT cabling, water, gas and waste distribution.  It is important that all service penetrations are appropriately fire stopped, using fire rated materials, by a competent fire stopping professional who is able to certify the works.  These service penetrations should be asset tagged, inventorised in the building O&amp;M manual, and inspected periodically for deterioration thereafter.</p>
<p>It is important that the same principles are applied to subsequent modifications to the building, so that as the building is updated and maintained over time, its compartmentation strategy does not break down.  As service penetrations are often hidden within voids, it is important that works are checked at completion and prior to acceptance to ensure that the building compartmentation strategy has not been compromised.</p>
<h6 id="windows">Windows</h6>
<p>Fire may also spread between compartments through glazing.  Internal glazing onto escape routes should be manufactured of fire rated construction.</p>
<h6 id="external-wall-systems">External Wall Systems</h6>
<p>In extreme cases, where fire has broken out of the compartment of origin through the external windows, it is possible that fire can spread over the external facade to the building, with heat and smoke impacting other compartments.</p>
<p>To summarise, the concept of compartmentation is central to the successful evacuation of buildings in the UK, on the one hand securing the viability of the means of escape, and on the other the assurance behind &lsquo;stay-put&rsquo; and phased evacuation strategies in certain buildings.</p>

		<a href="https://lee-perry.co.uk/2023/02/06/building-risk-profiles.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2023-02-06 22:18:32 &#43;0000">Feb 6, 2023</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Building Risk Profiles are a fairly straightforward way of categorising buildings from a fire safety point of view, yet a concept that many fire risk assessor interviewees are surprisingly unfamiliar with.  This article provides an introduction to the concept.</p>
<h3 id="risk-profiles">Risk Profiles</h3>
<p>The building risk profile is a concept derived from <em>BS9999:2017 Fire safety in the design, management and use of buildings – Code of practice</em>.</p>
<p>The risk profile is a composite of two factors, the type of occupancy, and the fire growth rate.  So a building with the risk profile A1 benefits from occupants who will be awake and familiar with the building, and limited combustible material, where one with C4 contains sleeping occupants and large bulk storage of combustible material (Note B4 and C4 are not acceptable under BS9999).</p>
<h6 id="table-4">Table 4</h6>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Note that according to 6.5 of BS9999 automatic sprinkler systems provide an efficient means of controlling fire within a compartment, and as such the fire growth rate can be lowered by one level in the sprinklered rooms.  This reduction should only be applied where the sprinkler system has been installed to BS EN 12845 (new) or BS 5306-2 (existing).</p>
<h3 id="why-are-building-risk-profiles-important">Why are building risk profiles important?</h3>
<p>When applying the principles of BS9999, buildings with higher risk profiles generally require lower levels of protection, can afford higher exit capacity, and support longer travel distances compared to buildings with lower risk profiles.  As such the building risk profile talks directly to level of control required when applying BS9999.</p>
<p>We will return to this principle in much more detail in later later articles.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>This article describes how building legislation in England and Wales influences the fire safety of buildings in occupation.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The Building Act 1984 set out the framework for Building Regulations to be made, and for Documents to be Approved providing practical Guidance.  Approved Document B provides practical guidance on how to comply with the functional fire safety requirements set out in the Building Regulations 2010, which were made under the Act.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="building-act-1984">Building Act 1984</h2>
<p>The Building Act 1984 is the primary buildings legislation in England and Wales (Scotland and Northern Ireland have their own regimes which will be described separately).</p>
<p><strong>Section 1</strong> provides the Secretary of State with the powers to make regulations for the purposes of securing the safety of people in buildings with relation to the design, construction and demolition of buildings, and the services fittings and equipment provided in connection with buildings.</p>
<p>It is these powers that allow the government to set out building regulations, laying out the fire safety design requirements for buildings.</p>
<p><strong>Section 6</strong> provides the Secretary of State with the powers to approve documents providing practical guidance on the requirements set out in Building Regulations.  Though <strong>Section 7</strong> makes clear that failing to comply with an approved document is not in of itself an offence, but in proceedings would point towards liability, where compliance would point towards non-liability.  These presumptions change the emphasis - where the defender can show that the approved document was implemented, the pursuer or prosecutor must prove that the law was broken.  Where the approved document was not implemented, the defender must prove that it was not.</p>
<p><strong>Section 15</strong> Places a duty on the local authority to consult with the Fire and Rescue Authority prior to relaxing requirements set out in Building Regulations in relation to:</p>
<ul>
<li>structural fire precautions</li>
<li>means of escape</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="building-regulations-2010">Building Regulations 2010</h2>
<p>The Building Regulations 2010 are secondary instruments made under the Building Act 1984.  Regulation 4 requires <em>building work</em> to comply with <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2010/2214/schedule/1/made">schedule 1</a>, while Regulation 6 requires material changes in use to conform to parts of schedule 1, including for fire safety purposes parts B1,B2,B3,B4(2) and B5.</p>
<p>Schedule 1 sets out the functional requirements for safety in buildings:</p>
<ul>
<li>B1 - Means of warning and escape</li>
<li>B2 - Internal fire spread (linings)</li>
<li>B3 - Internal fire spread (structure)</li>
<li>B4 - External fire spread</li>
<li>B4(2) - (roof only)</li>
<li>B5 - Access and facilities for the fire service.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="approved-document-b">Approved Document B</h2>
<p>The functional requirements set out in Schedule 1 to the Building Regulations are high level, goal setting objectives.</p>
<p>To provide a detailed means of achieving those objectives HM Government has published two volumes of Approved Document B which set out a design specification to comply with the functional requirements.
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/fire-safety-approved-document-b">Approved Document B (fire safety): Volume 1 - Dwellings</a>
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/fire-safety-approved-document-b">Approved Document B (fire safety): Volume 2- Buildings other than dwellings</a></p>
<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<ol>
<li>The requirement in respect of approved documents set out in Section 7 of the 1984 Act is to comply with the document at the time in force.  As such there is no requirement to improve the fire safety design of buildings as the specification strengthens within future editions of Approved Document B.</li>
<li>The law applies to new buildings, or to buildings when they undergo material change.  So again, unless there is a material change to a building, no requirement to upgrade the fire safety design is triggered.</li>
<li>For this reason a number of other guides and standards have been produced for the management of fire safety in buildings post-occupation, we will return to look at these in a subsequent article.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="degradation">Degradation</h2>
<p>Some proposed alterations to buildings will degrade or remove existing fire precautions.  According to Regulation 3 of the Building Regulations that alteration will be material, and therefore building work, if it causes B1,B3,B4,B5 (or part M, access) to be not complied with where it had been, or to be less complied with.</p>
<p>This is a significant protection - as it requires building notice and plans to be submitted for alterations that remove or degrade provisions under Regulation 12.</p>
<p>We hope that you found this explanation useful, please join the conversation below.</p>

<p>How looking for the best hosting and software options for one website led to a project consolidating most of my personal online and social media presence into a single website connected into the fediverse through Mastodon.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;d spent a little while prevaricating over hosting / design for a new project over at <a href="https://safetyfactor.co.uk">safetyFator</a>.  I&rsquo;d looked at various options:</p>
<ul>
<li>I knew that I did not want another bloated Wordpress build.</li>
<li>I like building in <a href="https://processwire.com">Processwire</a>, though for this project I just wanted to get on with content.</li>
<li>I also like developing in, and have built some fairly complex sites in Jekyll on GitHub pages - but again on this project, I just wanted to get on with content.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;d also investigated Ghost CMS which looks amazing, and micro.blog.</li>
</ul>
<p>I was particularly intrigued by <a href="https://micro.blog">micro.blog</a>, as I could see that all of the writers on that site had a Hugo website behind the scenes, a similar but faster static site generator to Jekyll, and I really just wanted to work in markdown.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d have probably opted for Ghost, especially if I had an established publication, but the cost seemed excessive on top of my existing hosting costs for a new niche project that may just not gain traction, so instead decided to give micro.blog a try to see if it could do what I wanted.</p>
<h2 id="safetyfactor">safetyFactor</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://safetyfactor.co.uk">safetyFator</a> build was very straightforward.  I opted for the <a href="https://github.com/am1t/microdotblog-anatole">Anatole</a> theme ported to micro.blog by <a href="https://micro.blog/amit">@amit</a>, set up the taxonomies and about information, and started writing.  I&rsquo;ve made some customisations to the theme along the way, but essentially that site was very quick to build.</p>
<p>It was during this project that I realised how closely micro.blog could be integrated into Mastodon through the activity pub protocol.  I&rsquo;d been rehoming myself on mastodon in any case - Twitter had been insipid and void to me for best part of a decade, Facebook I only really use for engaging in various virtual cycling communities/teams, and more latterly had been using Instagram more, as I just felt that my feed was more interesting, more geared towards what I actually read.</p>
<p>So combined with reading around content ownership and the Fediverse, I got round to thinking, how about if I also bring my personal website across to micro.blog, and use it to syndicate my short-form text, articles, static content, and photography across the Fediverse from a single source of content that I own?</p>
<h2 id="lee-perrycouk">lee-perry.co.uk</h2>
<p>I decided to experiment, setting up a second micro.blog subscription to use for my personal content.</p>
<p>This project was much bigger, and involved bring across several hundred posts, and maybe a dozen static pages, from my hosted Wordpress website.</p>
<p>On the whole the migration worked really well.  The posts came across seamlessly, bringing the media with them.  The images probably need styling, but that can be done over the next while - especially as I am planning to set all the galleries up to work in <a href="https://micro.blog/jsonbecker">@jsonbecker</a>&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/jsonbecker/plugin-glightbox">GLightbox</a> plugin.  Plugin setup is super simple in micro.blog too - there is a small range of plugins that you can add and remove directly in the micro.blog portal.</p>
<p>The pages were harder work.  First up the Wordpress post importer in micro.blog only seems to import posts.  I had to recreate the pages manually.  That was fine, it did not really take too long, though did involve lifting and copying in substantial html tables that contain hill lists, and my records of when I completed each.  I need to go back through the lists at some point, updating all of the urls.  The way they worked on my previous site was to search the site for reference to the hill/mountain name, returning relevant articles.  Once all of the lists have been updated, a similar experience will be produced using <a href="https://micro.blog/sod">@sod</a>&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/svendahlstrand/plugin-search-space">search-space</a> plugin.</p>
<p>Having lifted my website up, I decided to import all of my instagram posts into micro.blog too.  That was easy enough, though the official instructions for this need to be updated to direct to the correct export file to import.  Other than that though, it was very straightforward.</p>
<p>Moving from a Wordpress environment I lost the jetpack statistics that I have relied upon until now, and also wanted to move away from Google Analytics to take a more privacy oriented approach to analytics.  There are a couple of analytics plugins in micro.blog, though I used Clicky - inserting the tracking code into my custom footer.</p>
<h2 id="roadmap">Roadmap</h2>
<p>So at this point I have essentially consolidated my entire web presence onto a single website feeding out into Mastodon through micro.blog.  I have customised some of the theming to meet my needs, including adding reading time into archives and posts.  I still have some additional customisation that I want to build:</p>
<ul>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Separate archives for short form text and articles.</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Pagination in the photo stream.</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Categorisation within photo stream too.</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Continuing to finish rebuilding my original article bank, which had stalled even in the previous build.</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Rebuilding all image galleries in GLightbox.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="more-sites">More sites?</h2>
<p>Having successfully brought my main website across, and streamlined my writing workflow in doing so, I&rsquo;m left with a few decisions to make about some of my other projects.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://macretro.co.uk">MacRetro</a> is easily the most successful website that I&rsquo;ve ever run, though has been a little stagnant since I last had time to do much retro gaming.  Do I leave it where it is, bring it across, and either way begin to revive the project?  Much probably depends on how the earlier migrations work from an existing search optimisation perspective.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://insiderrr.uk">InsideRRR</a> is a Virtual Cycling project that never really gained traction.  Probably need to decide if this is a project that I want to continue with, and if I do, whether it just moves under my main domain.  To move across probably needs a better approach to mapping and metrics visualisation than currently possible.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It has been an enjoyable and productive switch so far, I&rsquo;m likely to consolidate more - subject to being able to provide more flexibility to the reader on what they see.  I need to think about how to structure that more before moving forward.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Coming into force on 23 January 2023, Regulation 4 of the Fire Safety (England) Regulations 2022 required responsible persons of high rise residential buildings to install secure property information boxes in or on their buildings, and to check it at least annually to ensure that the content remains up to date.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Premises information boxes serve to make building and apparatus information readily available to the fire and rescue service in the event of attendance to the building.  The box must contain the contact details for the responsible person, and <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2022/547/regulation/6/made">Regulation 6</a> specifies further what the box must contain:
[] Floor plans for each level within the building
[] A single page block plan identifying the building and environ, and the location of the firefighting features installed within.</p>
<p>The legislation implements recommendation 6 of the <a href="https://assets.grenfelltowerinquiry.org.uk/GTI%20-%20Phase%201%20full%20report%20-%20volume%204.pdf">Grenfell Tower Inquiry: Phase I Report</a> which was published in October 2019, and following which the Fire Industry Association (FIA) and National Fire Chiefs Council (NFCC) published the <a href="https://www.nationalfirechiefs.org.uk/write/MediaUploads/NFCC%20Guidance%20publications/Protection/PIBS_Guide_06-21_V2.pdf">Code of Practice for the Provision of Premises Information Boxes in Residential Buildings</a> in December 2020.  So though the legislation itself is new, building owners and managing agents will have been aware that this change was incoming for over 3 years.</p>
<p>The guidance actually goes further than the legislation, suggesting that the principles within are also relevant to smaller blocks with addition complexity, to mid rise accommodation 11-18m in height designed to accommodate a stay put policy, and also to new builds taller than 11m.</p>
<h2 id="location-of-premises-information-boxes">Location of Premises Information Boxes</h2>
<p>Premises Information boxes need to be installed where firefighters can readily access them in the event of an emergency, and in close proximity to any control equipment that may need to be operated.  So in determining the location of placement, consideration should be given to the point of access for the fire and rescue service, and of any firefighting controls.</p>
<p>The guidance suggests that a premises information box is required per block, however notes that for additional boxes may be required at larger more complex blocks with multiple access points.  It similarly identifies that for straightforward estates with multiple mid and low rise blocks, it my be possible to install a smaller number of boxes strategically placed at the access points for the fire and rescue service.</p>
<p>Finally, for staffed blocks, it is possible to position the box in the concierge&rsquo;s room - supported by way-finding signage for the fire and rescue service.</p>
<h2 id="security-of-premises-information-boxes">Security of Premises Information Boxes</h2>
<p>The premises information boxes should be secure, with access restricted to firefighters by a copy protected key, and provided to the Fire and Rescue Service.  This helps to ensure both that firefighters can access the box in the event of an emergency, and that the information remains within and has not been defaced.</p>
<h2 id="signage">Signage</h2>
<p>The position of the Premises Information Box should be demarked with a &ldquo;PIB for Fire and Rescue Service Use Only” firefighting equipment sign conforming to BS 5499-10.</p>
<h2 id="emergency-response-pack">Emergency Response Pack</h2>
<p>In addition to the building and orientation plans required in the legislation the code of practice suggests that the premises information box should be provided with details of specific fire safety issues in the building, a summary of the building evacuation strategy, and details of residents with mobility, cognitive or sensory impairments.</p>

			 <p>Having inadvertently ridden Innsbruckring over the weekend, I was fairly confident that I could race well tonight.  At least as fairly confident as it is possible to be having completely fallen apart the week before!</p>
<p>Getting on early, I headed over to the volcano circuit on Watopia to ensure that I was properly warmed up in advance, averaging around 90% FTP across the 10 minute ride.</p>
<p>Dropping into the race I tried to hold onto the lead pack, and managed to do so for the first half a lap.  I missed the sharp incline up from the river, and it was too late by the time that I had started to crank up the power.</p>
<p>I spent the rest of the race trying to climb back as far as I could up the field, exchanging drafts G. Stewart, and then with K.Grant, before bridging to a larger group between 40th and 45th place.  That split a little in the approach to the finish, and despite a strong effort on the straight, finished 44/54.</p>
<p>On the whole, a big step forward from last week, and still a little room for improvement.  With a little more race savvy I should have held onto the lead group for longer, and a finish 10-15 places higher might have been possible.  Though an average heart rate of 179bpm would suggest working pretty hard, and need to race smarter.</p>

			 <p>On 23rd January 2023 the Fire Safety (England) Regulations 2022 come into force.  The Home Office has published its <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/fire-safety-england-regulations-2022/fact-sheet-fire-doors-regulation-10">Fact Sheet</a> on the requirement for inpection of fire doors, including flat front-doors, in multi-occupant residential buildings taller than 11m.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The requirements require responsible persons, more about who they are in a later post, to undertake:</p>
<ul>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Quarterly checks of all fire doors to the common parts of these buildings.</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> To use best endeavours to inspect all of the residential flat front door</li>
</ul>
<p>This presents responsible persons with two practical problems:</p>
<ol>
<li>Content of fire door inspections, and competency of resource required</li>
<li>Access to the apartment side of residential front doors</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="fire-door-inspection">Fire Door Inspection</h3>
<p>Here the government sets out that it expects visual only checks that do not specialist resource, or tools.  However, it then sets out the content of the checks required - which really need both tools, as a minimum a simple gap testing gauge, and specialist knowledge! especially when applying the additional information in the guidance to regulations <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/fire-safety-england-regulations-2022-fire-door-guidance/fire-safety-england-regulations-2022-fire-door-guidance">here</a>.</p>
<p>As follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A responsible person should consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>if there has been any alterations or damage to a door’s glazing apertures or air transfer grille</li>
<li>if there are any gaps around the door frame and that seals and hinges are fitted correctly</li>
<li>that the door closer shuts the door</li>
<li>that the door closes correctly around the whole frame</li>
<li>that there is no visible damage (either deliberate or from wear and tear) to the door or door closer</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="access">Access</h3>
<p>There will always be challenges in access to the residential side of flat front doors, given that residents may not be in, may be asleep, or may otherwise not wish to permit the flat-side of the door to be inspected.  In these circumstances the responsible person needs to record the efforts and communications made to be able to demonstrate that best endeavours have been made to inspect the door.</p>

			 <p>Iâve become increasingly good at getting training volume in over the last few years, without getting the results that I wanted out of that in terms of competitiveness and weight.</p>
<p>With two marathons this year and as many Parkruns that @craftedbypanda allows me out for, I need to be leaner, lighter and faster.</p>
<p>One of the changes Iâm making in 2022 is to maintain a food diary. Iâm using nutracheck, but plenty of other options out there.  I wonât achieve my goals by training alone.</p>
<p>Mainly to keep myself accountable while working next door to the kitchen, and to run a flight calorie deficit to reduce weight slowlyâ¦. also to make sure that I fuel correctly for training and recovery.</p>
<p>About 21lbs to go to a sensible race weightâ¦</p>

			 <p>Video and step by step walkthrough - how to install Caesar III ready to play using Crossover on MacOS with M1/M2 chips.</p>
<hr>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Video &raquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><strong>n.b. also see our guide to <a href="https://lee-perry.co.uk/2023/06/05/play-caesar-iii.html">playing in widescreen hd</a> natively on MacOS using the Julius project.</strong></p>
<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>
<p>Before getting started there are a couple of things that we need.</p>
<ol>
<li>First of all we need a copy of Caesar III ready to install.  We recommend that you obtain the version that GOG have produced <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/caesar_3">here</a>. It costs buttons, is DRM free, and we&rsquo;ve tested it, it works!</li>
<li>Crossover from Dreamweavers, <a href="https://www.codeweavers.com/crossover">here</a>.  Crossover comes with a cost - if you can find a working discount code, you should be able to pick it up for around £30.  We could not get Caesar III working on PlayonMac on our M1 MacBook Air, and we understand that Virtual Machine approaches (ie parallels) will not currently work (though we&rsquo;ve not tested that.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once you have Codeweavers and a copy of Caesar III, you are all set and ready to play Caesar III on your shiny new M1 Mac.</p>
<hr>
<p>First up, open up your Crossover install, and select the <strong>Install a Windows Application</strong> button at the bottom of the screen.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Type the name of the application you want to install - in this case Caesar III.  Ignore the two star rating saying that the game will install but not run.  Thats mince.  Click continue.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>On the next screen that loads we need to select the installer.  We are not going to use the default <strong>Install via Steam</strong> option, we&rsquo;ve not tested that that.  Instead select <strong>Choose Installer File</strong>.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Select the install executable, and then click continue.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Next we need to tell Crossover what type of Bottle to create.  Again, we do not want to create a Windows 7 64-Bit bottle.  Most old Windows games need to run in a 32 bit environment!  Choose the option for the Standard Windows XP Bottle - even though Crossover says it is incompatible!</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Finally click the install button to create the bottle, think of a bottle as a discreet virtual machine, and watch Crossover run its magic.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Click on the checkbox to accept the EULA agreement, and then click on the install button to begin the process of installing Caesar III on you M1 Mac.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>After watching the install progress you should arrive at the install complete screen - click exit from here rather than launch game, as Crossover still needs to finish off tidying up the bottle.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Wait until you also receive the installation complete screen within Crossover itself:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>You should now see a Caesar III bottle on the left hand panel of Crossover - click on that, then click on the Caesar III icon within to load the game.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Enjoy the opening credits as Caesar III loads:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Click on the <strong>Start new career</strong> button and follow the prompts to get started playing Caesar III:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Finally, your game will load ready for you to begin your Governorial career on Caesar III - even though everything above says this will not work (it does)!  Enjoy the game!</p>

			 <p>Rocco was always sat by my side as I trained, so I wanted to finish off the events that I had started while he was here.</p>
<p>This is me finishing off the Tour of Bright on Fulgaz, just half an hour before the event closed.  Easily the biggest and toughest ride that I&rsquo;ve done in a while, and an emergency cookie was required towards the end as I started to bonk.  Every time I felt drained, I just thought of him and it gave me the strength to carry on.  The cookie helped too.</p>
<p>Next up I need to finish off the xmastour on Kinomap, though I&rsquo;ve a little longer  before those events complete.

<p>The B Class License tests contains a number of basic driving stop/start and manoeuvring challenges.  Without the B Class License you can only enter single races and time trials, the reward for completion being access to the Sunday Cup Event and the FF, FR, 4WD and Lightweight category challenge events.</p>

			 <p>One of the easier challenges in the Championship Manager / Football Manager series was to take a fallen giant and take them back through the leagues to their position of former glory. The infrastructure and the fan base is already there to help you (re)build great things - but with those advantages come great expectations. Don&rsquo;t be surprised at being unseated, should your progress not match those expectations.</p>
<p>One such challenge in CM0102 (running the 3.9.68 patch) is Fiorentina, who had been recently demoted from European greats to the fourth tier of the Italian football - so much so that you start the first season with a UEFA cup spot. The squad has not been entirely decimated, leaving you with some good players, but also carrying huge debt.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Read on to follow our progress back through the Italian leagues.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The start of the game also presents an opportunity to sign some big talent available on free transfers. We pick up Adam Matsyek between the posts, Ivan Hurtado and Taribo West come in to strengthen defence, and we bring in Moreno Torricelli and Gustavo Mendez to patrol the flanks.</p>
<p>[gallery columns=&ldquo;2&rdquo; size=&ldquo;medium&rdquo; ids=&ldquo;1713,1714,1715&rdquo;]</p>
<p>With a strong balanced team we encounter little challenge on our way to the Serie C2B Title, or to the Serie C Cup, going undefeated in domestic competition all year. We all have a strong European campaign, finally succumbing in the Quarter final of the UEFA cup to follow Italians Parma after inspired victories against stronger Nantes and Wolfsburg sides.</p>
<p>[gallery columns=&ldquo;2&rdquo; size=&ldquo;medium&rdquo; ids=&ldquo;1712,1711,1709,1708,1710&rdquo;]</p>
<p>None of which brings any money, and we continue to haemorrhage money through the year. As the club begins to prepare for bankruptcy in the spring a new investor comes in clearing the clubs debts, and providing a small but useful transfer kitty for the following season. Leandro is very much the star of the campaign, firing in the goals to start our journey back up the league.</p>
<p>[gallery size=&ldquo;medium&rdquo; columns=&ldquo;2&rdquo; ids=&ldquo;1707,1706,1705,1702&rdquo;]</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The outlay was almost entirely fully funded by departures from the club, most notably Angelo Di Livio and Taribo West.  With the former a last opportunity was taken to both cash in and relieve the wage bill, and our hand was force in the latter by the fee and destination.</p>
<p>[gallery columns=&ldquo;2&rdquo; size=&ldquo;medium&rdquo; ids=&ldquo;1700,1699,1698,1697&rdquo;]</p>
<p>As a result the second season was a breeze in the park in comparison to the first, Fiorentina demolishing all they came across, winning the league early and convincingly, and undefeated.  We also rapped up the Serie C Cup again with a convincing two leg victory over Bari, and also the Serie C1 Super Cup against Crotone.  Topping the league we avoided the play offs for the second season in a row.</p>
<p>[gallery columns=&ldquo;2&rdquo; size=&ldquo;medium&rdquo; ids=&ldquo;1695,1694,1693,1692,1691&rdquo;]</p>
<p>The summer signings performed well too.  Tsigalko sweeping all before him on his way to player of the year and golden boot awards, with Kristian Bergstrom getting closest to him, and creating an enviable number of assists along the way.</p>
<p>[gallery size=&ldquo;medium&rdquo; columns=&ldquo;2&rdquo; ids=&ldquo;1690,1689,1688,1687&rdquo;]</p>
<p>Season 2002/3 was a breeze.</p>

This is a tough map.  There are a couple of ways to route through the Alps, but concentrate on making your money in the northern Italian cities, and using the profits to fund the pout through the Alps.  You can also run a few lines out from Munich to accelerate earnings here.</p>

Be sure to extend out to the big connections in Holland, Belgium and Luxembourg before any of your competitors get there.

			 <p>The ability to set out the sources of health and safety law is a topic that is frequently examined, and the level of complexity of the answer depends on the level of course that you are studying.</p>
<p>For completeness this introductory article deals with the key concepts.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Types of Law<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Most jurisdictions benefit from two types of law:</p>
<ol>
<li>Criminal Law - which is concerned with offences against the state, and</li>
<li>Civil Law - which is concerned with offences against the person.</li>
</ol>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sources of Law<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
In addition to which each of these two types of law generally have (the same) two sources of law:</p>
<ol>
<li>Legislation - Statutes passed by the state and (in common law jurisdictions)</li>
<li>Common Law - The body of precedents set in judicial decisions.</li>
</ol>
<p>Again, we&rsquo;ll return to these components in further articles and within the study guides we are writing, but for now note that we are concerned with two types and two sources of law.</p>

			 <p>One of the key challenges for the occupational health and safety profession in general is overcoming the misconception that health and safety management is either trivial on the one hand, or there to stop people doing things on the other.  Unsurprisingly this topic features at some point in pretty much every health and safety course too!</p>
<p>The reasons employers and businesses should manage health and safety are generally split in to three areas.</p>
<ol>
<li>Moral</li>
<li>Financial</li>
<li>Legal</li>
</ol>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Moral<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Poor management of health and safety often results in employees or members of the public being harmed or made ill.  This line of argument proposes that employers have a moral duty to ensure that their employees and visitors return home in the same condition that they arrived in.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Financial<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Bad health and safety management is bad for business too, with associated costs which are often categorised as <!-- raw HTML omitted -->direct<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->indirect<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. So this line of argument proposes that it is better for a businesses bottom line to manage health and safety properly, than not to do so.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Legal<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Employers must also adequately manage health and safety because the law requires them to.  This also has two strand. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Criminal Law<!-- raw HTML omitted --> dictates that it is an offence not to manage health and safety properly while <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Civil Law<!-- raw HTML omitted --> provides a remedy to those who are injured because of their employers&rsquo; failings.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll come back to these key principles in more detail throughout this site - but for now remember that if asked in an examination for the reasons why employers should manage health and safety, that there are three main strands - Moral, Financial and Legal.</p>
<p>The following course units will cover this topic in more detail:
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Managing Safely - Unit 1<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Safety for Executives and Directors - Unit 1<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->NGC1 | Managing Health &amp; Safety - Unit 2<!-- raw HTML omitted -->

			 <p>Playing through the fourth map of the Railroad Tycoon II campaign, on macOS, using the PlayOnMac Windows emulator.  This map simulates the building of railways to service the gold rush, and is concerned primarily with the generation of personal wealth.</p>
<p>We played through this map several times trying to perfect our strategy.  That which worked best for us was using capital, leverage and bonds to maximise shareholding early, Using 3 of four discrete lines between major centres to provide income, and using that income both to buy back equity and pay dividends to fund onward acquisition.  This strategy came very close to securing gold completion - but not quite!</p>

			 <p>Playing through the third map of Railroad Tycoon II, on macOS, using the PlayOnMac Windows emulator.  This map simulates the building of the first railway across the USA, by building a railway from St. Louis to Sacramento, St. Paul to Seattle or New Orleans to Los Angeles.</p>
<p>We have opted for the first option - building from St Louis to Sacramento.  Primarily because St. Louis is surrounded by large cities from which to derive a development income to fund the railway.  Our strategy involved putting in place that money making machine around St Louis, building a discreet railway around Sacramento and San Francisco, and ultimately building pretty much due east to connect the two networks.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t be surprised if we redo this map with the remaining options later in this series.  One of the reasons that we chose the first option was because we have completed that several times before and knew roughly how to approach it.  We may also revisit this video in due course, having marginally missed out on gold completion through mis-timing.</p>

			 <p>Playing through the second map of Railroad Tycoon II, on macOS, using the PlayOnMac Windows emulator.  This map simulates the building of the first railways across the Appalachians, by building a railway from New York City to Chicago.</p>
<p>There are probably many possible strategies by which to succeed at this map, and several routes across the Appalachians.  It makes sense though to use the route north already started for you, combining it with some short haul routes to nearby conurbations to generate more meaningful revenue in the early years, and a better shot at gold medal completion.</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I spent a couple of hours last night reliving my misspent youth by playing Gremlin&rsquo;s &ldquo;Footballer of the Year&rdquo; using the Fuse ZX Spectrum emulator. The game is a fairly basic shoot and score setup involving two defenders, one, or a penalty. The latter was always the most problematic given that any attempt to steer the ball sends it over or wide of the goalposts.</p>
<p>The game seemed to play a little strangely in Fuse, at least I seemed to get transferred more often than I remember. I won both the First Division (Premier League for you young &lsquo;uns) and the imaginative European Super League a several times with different teams. I didn&rsquo;t have much joy in any of the European Competitions - they only appear the season after winning Division 1 or a Cup. Due to the frequency at which I was transferred, I didn&rsquo;t even play a game in those competitions.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I did experience winning the &ldquo;Footballer of the Year&rdquo; title for about 5 years on the bounce.</p>

			 <p>How to manually configure your PlayOnMac install environment creating a stable environment for playing old Windows games on macOS/OSX.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/7tjg9pb84yU">youtu.be/7tjg9pb84&hellip;</a></p>
<p>Key points:</p>
<p>Download PlayOnMac <!-- raw HTML omitted -->here<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>Create your own virtual drives</p>
<ul>
<li>Create 32bit virtual drives - 64 bit will not work</li>
</ul>
<p>Install all of the extensions prompted during drive creation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wine Gecko</li>
<li>Wine Mono</li>
<li>XQuartz</li>
</ul>
<p>You will also generally get better results gaming in full screen rather than windowed mode, from what we have seen.</p>
<p>The methods used in this video should work for most of the old Windows games played at MacRetro - others may require more complex WINE configuration.  Having said that, and although the PlayOnMac installer (as opposed to this manual method) uses different WINE versions within PlayOnMac, we are struggling to think of a game that will play that does not simply work in the default system version of WINE shipped in PlayOnMac.</p>

			 <p>Installing Championship Manager 97/98 on MacOS/OSX using the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Boxer App<!-- raw HTML omitted --> DOS emulator.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltINESky9dc">www.youtube.com/watch</a></p>
<p>CM9798 is now abandonware - you can freely and legally download and play it if you are unable to find your install disc.</p>
<p>Open up your Boxer App (which we use at MacRetro for emulating DOS games), select the middle menu option to install a new game, drag your CM97/98 iso or game folder into the window that has appeared, and Boxer will install CM9798 into your games library.</p>
<p>The original game and versions with updated data can be found at: <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://www.cm97-98.eu">http://www.cm97-98.eu</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Some versions work, others won&rsquo;t we have a 15-16 update running, and also an original 97-98 version from elsewhere.</p>
<p>Once your game is installed (all of two seconds later), choose the file that you wish to run - usually bat.exe, and then whether you wish to run the 8MB or 16MB (RAM) version of the game.</p>
<p>The 8MB version lets you run a single league, the 16MB version 3.</p>
<p>And yes, that really does say MB.  We can not overemphasise how much difference and extra 8MB of RAM made to how fast this game ran.</p>
<p>Then you are good to go! Don&rsquo;t stay up all night&hellip;</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>CM01/02 for us is the best installment of the Championship Manager/Football Manager series from inception through to today. It benefits from more detail than it&rsquo;s predecessors while sharing their speed, and lacks the complexity and demands on time made by its successors.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/sFfjpO1s9WI">youtu.be/sFfjpO1s9&hellip;</a></p>
<p>Unusually CM01/02 does not install &ldquo;out of the box&rdquo; in PlayOnMac / PlayOnLinux - it will install manually though, and you can patch the game to 3.9.68. We haven&rsquo;t managed to get any of the Tapani patches running though.</p>
<p>Much more to follow on this game that has swallowed up so many days of our existence. Until then, here&rsquo;s the instructions to get it running:</p>
<p>The complete guide to installing, patching and updating CM0102 on Mac using PlayOnMac (These instructions also work identically on Linux using PlayOnLinux).</p>
<p>To install CM0102 you need:
PlayOnMac - <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="https://www.playonmac.com/en/">https://www.playonmac.com/en/</a><!-- raw HTML omitted -->  or
Play on Linux from <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="https://www.playonlinux.com/en/">https://www.playonlinux.com/en/</a><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
CM0102 - <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="https://champman0102.co.uk/downloads.php?do=file&amp;id=2">https://champman0102.co.uk/downloads.php?do=file&amp;id=2</a><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
3.9.68 Patch - <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="https://champman0102.co.uk/downloads.php?do=file&amp;id=3">https://champman0102.co.uk/downloads.php?do=file&amp;id=3</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>To patch your install to run faster, with crisper graphics, and current era data you also need:
Saturn Patch - <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="https://champman0102.co.uk/downloads.php?do=file&amp;id=298">https://champman0102.co.uk/downloads.php?do=file&amp;id=298</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<ul>
<li>remembering to choose a .exe from the first comment in that thread.
1024 x 800 Menu bars - <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://tapani.homeftp.org/cm/cmbg1280x800.zip">http://tapani.homeftp.org/cm/cmbg1280x800.zip</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --> or if down: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->here<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
1024 x 800 Backgrounds - <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="https://champman0102.co.uk/downloads.php?do=file&amp;id=100">https://champman0102.co.uk/downloads.php?do=file&amp;id=100</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --> (5 parts)</li>
</ul>
<p>Our next mission is to get the CM8990 running on Mac.  First though we need a Tapanified .exe and data folder.</p>
<p>Common problems:</p>
<ol>
<li>Do not create a 64bit virtual machine</li>
<li>Remember to mount your CM0102.iso before playing</li>
<li>Remember to eat, drink and to pause occasionally for sleep!</li>
</ol>
<p>Detailed instructions on following page - but they need to be updated to match the new video.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>First obtain and mount a copy of the CM0102 iso from the publishers - its free! here: <a href="http://champman0102.co.uk/downloads.p...">champman0102.co.uk/downloads&hellip;</a></p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t just run the installer though, it won&rsquo;t work - you need to install CM01/02 manually. To do this open PlayOnMac or PlayOnLinux and click the configure button in the ribbon menu.</p>
<p>You need to create a virtual drive to install CM01/02 on within PlayOnMac/Linux. Click the New button at the bottom left, which should open up a wizard. Click Next, select the system version of wine on the next screen, and click next again. Next call the drive whatever you want to, click next one last time, and your virtual environment is created.</p>
<p>Next we need to install CM01/02. Your new drive should have appeared on the left hand side of the configure screen in PlayOnMac/Linux. Select it; and choose the miscellaneous tab to the top right. On that tab select the option run a windows executable in this virtual drive. From there navigate to the CM01/02 iso that you have mounted and select the install executable, CM01/02 will install. If you have any patches to apply to the game then you can do that the same way.</p>
<p>Once you have installed the game switch from the miscellaneous tab of the virtual drive to the general tab. Select the &ldquo;Make new shortcut from this virtual drive&rdquo; button. This should identify the CM01/02 executables - install a shortcut to the game now.</p>
<p>You can now close the configure tab, and the shortcuts you have just added will be present in PlayOnMac/Linux - double click on one and the game will run. Remember to mount the CM01/02 iso before playing next time too.</p>

			 <p>Having reflected on 2013 and taken a couple of weeks off, 2014 has started in earnest with a good pool session yesterday, followed by a good 7 odd mile circuit out in very strong wind this morning.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The plans for 2014 are twofold, firstly to run well throughout my race program, and secondly to continue preparations for racing long distance triathlons the following year.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I am hoping that this coming winter will be better from a training perspective having received an asthma diagnosis in the last year or so, and being in better control of my chest and breathing as a result.  This winter needs to be better as 2014 starts a good month or so earlier than last year with the Barcelona Marathon in mid March, and building steadily towards the Highland Fling at the end of April.  Having resisted the urge to add anything major into May, June and July next up is Devil o the Highlands at start of August and the year concludes with a crack at the Ultima Frontera 166km in Andalucia in mid-October.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->All of these races are achievable, and looking at the run this morning I am in a much better position than I was at this point last year, and running within 30 sec/mi of my best pace last year whilst feeling very under fuelled, under hydrated, and bizarrely warm given the strong cold wind blowing across.  All this of course bodes well for 2014 but challenges still remain, particularly in relating to improving prerace and race nutrition and hydration.  Post race nourishment has never been a problem!<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

			 <p>Having wrapped up my racing year a week or so ago I wanted to take a little time to reflect on the events of the past 10 months or so before running through a quick debrief of the year from a different perspective perhaps from which I wrote at the time.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->As per the last couple of years the start to 2013 was a slow one for me.  Following the Glen Ogle 33 race back in 2011 I had contracted bronchitis which knocked me sideways for several months.  I had put this down to surrounding myself with grotty students at Warwick University the following week.  After the 2012 edition though I experienced very similar symptoms, culminating in my lying in a ball on the floor struggling to breathe on the evening of the race. I was not surprised to be ultimately diagnosed with exercise acquired asthma.  After all, the medication that had fixed my previous episode was not the antibiotics prescribed, but Salbutamol, an asthma reliever, which had also proved quite handy at allowing me to breathe after to 2012 edition.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Training started quite slowly, despite having obtained a ballot place in the London Marathon, and didn&rsquo;t really get going much until February.  Towards the start of the month I met up with my revolutionary new running buddies from the dark side of Kintore, hill repping away as much as my chest would permit.  Later in the month I arrived in Vietnam where, warm and dry, I put away a considerable number of miles on various air conditioned treadmills while also getting in a memorable road run out to and along the beach at Hoi An.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Vietnam treadmilling had put me back in better shape, although returning home at about 13st 4lb I was still far too heavy.  Training continued pretty well on my return to Aboyne up until the London Mararthon, not as quick as maybe I had run previously at times, but fairly solid.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Around a week before the London Marathon I engaged <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Karl Zeiner<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to coach me, and i&rsquo;ll come back onto this a little later.  Obvoiusly in the five days pre-London there was very little that Karl could do to influence that race other than to provide some reassurance based upon the data I had managed to get into Strava at that point.  Our race plan was broadly to head out at 9 min/mi aiming to still be under 10 min/mi by the end of the race and broadly I slipped a little from this, but not too much, coming home in around 4:25:00 on a day that I found to be quite hot.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Getting back from London my next ultra, the Cateran Trail was just 4 weeks away and at 55 miles was always going to be a tough ask given the previous 18 months.  Training went really well though up to the race, and although it was always going to be tough, and I wouldn&rsquo;t be setting any records, I thought that I could finish it.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Cateran race started ok, but I always felt more laboured than normal, but I headed through the first checkpoint at Dalnagair Castle just about on plan.  The road section after here I took pretty quickly, and felt quite good, although on hitting the trail it began to become apparent that I was overheating and feeling nauseous, symptoms I recognised from previous accidents involving heavy handedness and electrolytes.  I dropped into CP at Kirtkton of Glenisla about on time, but feeling pretty rough, and continued on after a pretty disjointed hydration bladder refill in which I could not get the cap back on properly.  I felt even rougher heading on out and up the hill and decided there and then that I would be dropping out at Alyth, none of the prolonged debating with myself which I had gone on to ignore in previous races.  I had replaced my electrolyte with largely water at Kirkton of Glenisla, and although I began to feel better on the drop into Alyth the weather began to worsen, and I didn&rsquo;t really fancy a long slog in the rain and wind.  So in short, although I&rsquo;d had a pretty rough and unfortunate start to the race, the main reason that I did drop out was that my head wasn&rsquo;t in it.  A bad day at the office, and my first DNF.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I had a couple of months until my next race which would be the Clyde Stride Ultra at the start of July.  Training continued to go well, and along with ongoing physiotherapy sessions, particularly on both tibiali, along with various attachments running into the right knee, I was quite optimistic going into the Clyde Stride, hoping to hold onto 10 min/mi throughout the race.  I hopped on the train from my hotel in Milngavie down to Partick on what was a lovely morning.  I hit the first leg of the race pretty hard, but I didn&rsquo;t feel too hard, but the middle section of the race from the first checkpoint, through Strathclyde Country Park particularly to the last checkpoint I found very hot, and very tough.  The last leg was little short of a death march.  There were some plusses from the race, in particular my fuelling and hydration strategies had gone very well.  Ultimately I need to run better in hot weather, particularly with some of the races planned for 2014.  My race placing too was much improved from previous races, but I couldn&rsquo;t help but be disappointed with my overall time, and my flirtation with heatstroke for most of an afternoon - despite my silly dessert hat.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The period after the Clyde Stride defined really the remainder of the year.  A house move from Aboyne down to Dunfermline resulted in 3 weeks without training, in part due to 14 hour round trips in a van full of materialistic possessions, and followed by a less predicatable bout of infected bursitis in my left elbow brought on by manhandling bookcases.  Ok.  It was predictable.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The loss of training at the point put my key race for the year, the Ring o Fire, beyond reach I felt, and so I opted to grab a late entry into the Speyside Way Race from Ballindalloch into Buckie.  Again hoping to hold onto around 10 min/mi I would fall slightly short of that, but overall the race was a big success, and but for a slow down between Fochabers and Spey Bay could have been so much better.  I was pleased with the race, and with a strong kick at the finish, but also a little frustrated with myself for time lost in the latter stages of the race.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->My focus after Speyside turned towards hillrunning with the Pentland Skyline race pencilled in at the start of October.  On the whole I enjoyed this, but my key goal for the remainder of the year was to run well at Glen Ogle at the start of November.  My goals for the skyline race were limited, and I missed my target by about half an hour.  Given the bad weather this would probably have been acceptable except that again it should have been so much better.  On this occasion I got my fuelling wrong, and bonked all the way up the final climbs losing oodles of time as a result.  However, this was never a race that I was going to finish, and given a bug-riddled September was on that I had thought long and hard about whether to start.  In the end I decided to man up.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I was not much better fortunate with wee bugs during October, and although when I was running I was running faster than I had ever run before and I was 1st 4lb lighter than at London, I was struggling to obtain the level of consistency that I had managed upto the Speyside Way Race.  This was in part due to illness but also business commitments.  So when Glen Ogle came around I knew that I could run fast, but was slightly pessimistic about how fast I would run. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The start of the Glen Ogle race went really well.  I dropped out of the forest into Kingshouse well under my 10 min/mi target, and arrived at the checkpoint at the top of the glen similarly ahead of target, and gained even more time into the drop into the forest.  I knew that I would lose a lot of time on the big hill at the back of the course, and so I wasn&rsquo;t too concerned to drop back to the 3rd checkpoint at 10:45 min/mi, knowing that the remainder of the course was downhill, and that I was planning to &lsquo;drop the hammer&rsquo;.  Sadly the weather came in at this point and I lost any power in my quads on the descent, ultimately slipping to 11 min/mi.  This was not the deathmarch finish of previous Glen Oglee 33&rsquo;s, but in reality the last 9 miles of the race was no real improvement either.  I am disappointed with the overall result, but also recognise that a better September and October would have probably delivered the step change in result that I was looking for here.  The result was a big improvement.  But again I&rsquo;m frustrated because it could have been better.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Therein lies the dilemma then.  In short I am disappointed because I have improved so much in training this year, but do not feel that my results show that yet, although on several occasions I&rsquo;ve been pretty close to delivering.  Running the skyline race in October was probably a mistake ultimately, and probably prejudiced Glen Ogle, but I enjoyed the race and it fits well with some of the big mountain ultras that I am hoping to race in future.  I also ran the hills at Glen Ogle far stronger than I have ever run them before - the time that I lost was on the downhill, and but for that my PB improvement would have been more like 1h30 than the 45min achieved.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->So, reflecting finally on what has driven my improvements through the year, there are 3 main factors - training, maintenance and nutrition.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Firstly, since I began working with Karl my training has a much more realistic but consistent edge to it.  Yes I still do long runs, but I also do a lot more shorter stuff, hillwork and speedwork, and this has helped me to better condition myself heading into races, as has much more back to back work and double run / double discipline days.  No longer is running about distance, its also about how well I can run that distance, and I hope that heading into 2014 we can replicate the gains made this year and translate them into the longer races planned in 2014.  On a personal note I find Karl very knowledgeable and enthusiastic across the ultra endurance disciplines, realistic, pragmatic and adaptive in planning, and sufficiently scary to keep me training when I otherwise wouldn&rsquo;t.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->My maintenance strategy has been much more proactive, and I have gennerally booked physio sessions post-race as routine, as well as identifying niggles earlier and getting them fixed before they impacted upon training more generally.  I have spent much of the year under the care of Richard Batho of Deeside Physiotherapy and Victoria Davidson although I also need to identify more local support having relocated to the central belt.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Finally, my wife Vickie has done a lot of work on my fuelling strategy helping to create (and cook) fantastic eloctrolytic flapjack which has helped to reduce my hydration problems since the Cateran Trail Race, as well as following me around and helping me at race weekend through the year, and this has also manifested itself in my slow but sustained move away from the bottom of the results table.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->2014 then starts early with a tilt at the Barcelona Marathon in March, where I expect to be substantially below 4 hours, followed by the Highland Fling Race, Devil o the Highlands and culminating with the Ultima Frontera 166 in Andalucia in October.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->As mine starts on 19 November 2013&hellip;<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->¡<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Feliz Año Nuevo 2014<!-- raw HTML omitted -->!<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

			 <p>This weekend was one of back to back long runs, to last 3 hours on the Saturday, and 2 hours on the Sunday, which I had planned to do on the Deeside Way and Tarland Way respectively. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The weather on the Saturday was very sunny and warm, with hardly a cloud in the sky.  I held a pace of around 9:20 miles for the first two hours, slipping to 9:35 by the end of the run.  On the way out I ran past two very distinctive birds with black tipped white wings and a bright orange beak, and the view on the approach to Ballater was dominated by Lochnagar.  The view on the return was of the aerial activity from the glider field. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I woke on the Sunday feeling quite nauseous and tired, opting to run on the Deeside Way again to avoid some of the hillwork on the Tarland Way, which was probably a sensible choice.  The weather was somewhat cloudier and far more humid, spending much of the run sweating profusely.  If anything else I think that this is probably evidence that my hydration is working better.  I opted during the run to knock a half hour off, but despite feeling ill the pace was good throughout, holding around 9:20 miles, and slightly negative splitting the return from just past Dinnet. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I had hoped to spend much of this weekend running up in the Glen Tanar estate, but time and illness prevented this.  All in all though I have to be happy with the two runs this weekend. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->There are plenty of positives to take: <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->1.

			 <p>I headed out with some friends today on a big mountain run.  Starting out at the Spittal of Glen Muick car park we headed along Glen Muick and up onto Broad Cairn, which seemed to have a series of false tops prior to reaching the actual summit.  We then headed quite quickly onto Cairn Bannoch and onto Fafernie before making the decision to add Tolmount to our round, adding an extra 4 miles onto the overall tally before returning to Fafernie where we split into two groups, one returning the way we had come down to the cars, and an advance party continuing around the horseshoe.  We headed up quite quickly to Carn an t-Sagairt Mor and dropped onto the bealach beyond where we had lunch next to an airplane wing.  We then contoured below the sister top picking up the path to Carn a&rsquo; Choire Bhoidheach which we would have missed but for the rather obvious baggers path heading up it.  We had crossed several snow bands on the way which had sapped the energy from my legs somewhat.  We then rounded off the day with an ascent of Cac Carn Beag and Cac Carn Mor on Lochnagar.  I found the descent past Meikle Pap very loose and stony, and therefore painful and barely runnable for much of the way, and did not recover as much pace as I expected.  The weather was warm, the ground largely dry although I did soak my feet in a couple of bogs and in a burn at the end. I am quite tired now, so I will round this article off here, save for a few photographs below and the trip statistics:<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

			 <p>After the Scottish National Trail Challenge at the weekend I was offered the chance not to lead my Jog Scotland group on Tuesday which I gladly took up to build an extra rest day into this week.

			 <p>The second instalment of back to back long runs this weekend, I wasn&rsquo;t entirely sure how this would go and for that reason I didn&rsquo;t want to head too far from the house and so I did circuits of the village.  I had in mind that I would do 2 full circuits (about 5km each) and a truncated 3rd circuit, but as it was I ran faster than I had anticipated and so I did 3 full circuits with 5km splits of roughly 27, 28 and 29 minutes. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->This is a circuit that I normally use for runs of about half an hour, but opted to run laps of it in the Aberdeenshire sunshine.  It heads through the castle grounds, giving a view to the castle before heading past the village green, taking in the view of the hills, green and church before running out along the River Dee, and then climbing back towards the castle.  Had I realised that I would be moving so well I would probably have headed out to Glen Muick to do a circuit of the Loch in the shadow of Lochnagar.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The first hour of the run was fine, and I was moving quite well and freely, concentrating on maintaining good form.  I&rsquo;m conscious that as I tire my form fails, and then I tend to pick up silly injuries that relate to using a lazy stride.  The last half hour was harder, but not really any slower.  Again this run used a 14:1 run walk strategy which I am really happy with, and also as I said yesterday, surprised at the limited impact it has on average speeds whilst reaping the benefits of having a wee breather every 15 minutes (I am not excluding the walking splits from the data).  I&rsquo;m also finding it easier to stay on top of now that I have stopped trying to use the lap function on my watch, turning it off in error.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I have added a bit of a tagline to my header and to my <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Mission<!-- raw HTML omitted --> which sum up my thinking at the moment and what I want to get out of life.  I won&rsquo;t share the reasons why, but I&rsquo;m pretty fired up and motivated at the moment to go out there and just make this happen.  Any doubts about the Cateran 55 in two weeks have been put firmly to the back of my mind.  Failure is not an option.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I&rsquo;m now looking forward to some downtime as my next run will be on Tuesday evening.  Hopefully by then I will have freshened up, my legs will be moving freely, and my aggravated London blister will have healed.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Signing off until the next instalment.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

			 <p>The first of two back to back long runs this weekend, I decided to run up the Deeside Way from Deeside Gliding Club as far as a gate that allows you to cross the A93 into Cambus O&rsquo;May Forest from where I would attempt to find my way back to the car through the Burn O&rsquo;Vat visitor Centre, Loch Kinnord and Dinnet.  The other point of note is that this run utilised a 14:1 run:walks strategy.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Heading out from Deeside gliding club I was conscious that I wasn&rsquo;t running particularly quickly, and I was also frustrated by my watch still speaking to me in kilometres, which I don&rsquo;t understand, although I did manage to change this setting.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I made good time along the Deeside Way though, and steadily began to hold a pace of around 9:20 min/mi dropping to around 9:30 after each walking session.  I quickly found myself at the turn for Cambus, and debated with myself whether to take it, or to carry on to Ballater, as I was concerned by this point that I was likely to get back to my truck well before my 2:30 was up.  I opted to head in to the forest as this was a circuit that I had been plotting to do for a wee while, and one that I think there are probably other variants of.  The climb up to the forest was pretty harsh, and I stopped for a breather on the way, but I quickly reached the pass which was actually very waterlogged. Any navigational concerns disappeared when I saw the yellow arrows on the track that we follow in the Cambus Canter.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I then ran along a wet but stony track for a wee while until I came to a sign pointing downhill towards Burn O&rsquo;Vat and Loch Kinnord.  This wasn&rsquo;t what I had expected,, but went with it and sure enough dropped down towards the Vat on a track running along the top of a fairly steep ravine.  One small step would have been the end of this ultrarunning monkey.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I soon found myself at the visitor centre, from where I followed a good but intermittently surfaced track around Loch Kinnord, starting a couple of walkers as a flew past on the verge besides them, and shortly afterwards coming to the path heading out to Dinnet.  I found this track quite difficult in my Mudclaws as the ancient cobbles penetrated through to the bottom of my foot, but within 10 minutes I was in Dinnet, trying to remove stones from my shoe on the swing, which was quite a challenge.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sure enough I had arrived in Dinnet too soon, at about 1:50, and realised that I would be back at the truck by 2:10, part of this being to my not calculating the length of this route, and partly because I had run quicker than I had thought that I would.  I rectified this by heading out away from the truck on the Deeside way until the end of my run interval, and then turning around and running to the truck.  During this time I recovered most of the 10sec/mi I had gained climbing out of Cambus O&rsquo;May, which in itself I had been very pleased with, putting together some pretty handy sub 9min/mi splits in the process.  All in all a very successful outing, but we shall see what an hour and a half feels like tomorrow.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Climbing up through Cambus O&rsquo;May Forest<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Loch Kinnord<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Deeside Gliding Club<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

			 <p>I have requested to defer my Cateran Trail entry until 2013, because I have been experiencing a lot of knee pain following my longer training runs, have not been able to put the mileage in that I have needed to, and will not be able to rectify that sufficiently in the 4 weeks remaining.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->While I am very sad not to compete in the Cateran Trail race this year, and consequently will not entry sufficient SUMS races this year, I have to be optimistic about the opportunity that this presents.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I now have a window of 8 weeks before the Lairig Ghru race to concentrate on speed and building core strength through shorter races, and hopefully as a result will make great strides in improving my fitness, and consequently shedding some pounds.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I took the decision this weekend to enter the Aberdeen Parkrun rather than take on a prolonged training run, and that has paid dividends, I have been shedding pounds since the weekend, and the race itself felt quick, if not necessarily comfortable.  I am going out again this weekend to try to take a minute or so off my time.  I averaged 7:45 miles last weekend, but felt lethargic.  Having not raced, or even trained, anything this short for a long time it is a bit tricky to set out what my peak present form could be, but I think 7 minute miles and 21ish minutes over the next couple of months is possible.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->As a result lots of new races have found their way into my plans for the next few months:<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sat 28 April -Aberdeen Parkrun (5K)<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Say 05 May - Aberdeen Parkrun (5K)<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sun 13 May - Dunecht Dash (5K)<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sun 27 May - Dunblane Hydro 7.5M<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sat 02 June - Aberdeen Parkrun (5K)<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sun 03 June - Scolty Hill Race<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Thu 07 June - Cambus Canter<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sat 09 June - Aberdeen Parkrun (5K)<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Thu 14 June - Spring Series - Dalmedie<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

			 <p>After putting in a few 6 and 7 mile runs, as well as a few smaller runs and cycle rides, I set out on Sunday, not realising that it was April 1st, to put in a long run.  The plan was to run out form Orito to Agost, from there run down the road into Novelda, pick up a track to Monforte, before running back into Orito.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Broadly speaking the run went really well.  It seemed to start of quite slowly but picked up momentum during the climb into Agost.  I paused around the 9 mile mark to eat some food and take on some gel.  The electrolytes seemed to be working quite well, albeit a little too strong perhaps.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The pace carried on well from here most of the way down into Novelda at around mile 13-14, although my right knee started to hurt during this stretch and still does this (Monday) morning.  The views into Agost had been predominantly of El Maigmo, and on the stretch to Novelda were of the humpback mountain of Sierra del Cid.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Arriving in Novelda I picked up the wrong track for Monforte, which probably knocked a mile or two of the run, but by this stage (mile 15ish) the sun was getting quite high, and I was glad to have lost an extra 20 minutes in the sun.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I got lost, as I always do, on the way through Monforte, but did actually manage to pick up the right track to Orito, pausing in the shad on the bridge over the new high speed railway line briefly to cool, before running back into the village.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->All in all this was an exceptionally pleasant run with exceptional veiws, albeit a bit too hot at the end, and my knee hurts a bit from all the tarmac!<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Stats: 17.5 miles 2:53:49 2303kcal<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Splits: 10:38 9:35 9:25 9:37 10:03 9:52 9:51 9:44 9:29 9:48 9:48 9:39 10:0710:18 10:09 9:45 10:33 5:25</p>

			 <p>After a slow January the running is slowly starting to come back together.  A good 6 miles running with Steve on Thursday was followed by an 11 mile trot out on the Deeside Way today in the snow and on ice.  The pace was OK, not quick, but at 9:13 minute average miles was quicker than most of my prep for the Glen Ogle 33 and is also only around 5 minutes of the pace for my non downhill half marathon PB.  Not bad for my first run over 8 miles since GO 33.  I averaged a run a week through January, my two runs so far in February have already exceeded the total January mileage!<!-- raw HTML omitted -->There are times in January where I have felt that the D33 in March looked a stretch too far.  It has taken me far longer to come back from my bout of Bronchitis than I thought that it would.  That said I’m fairly confident after today, and the last couple of runs, that I can be ready in the remaining 7 weeks.  Albeit, I probably won’t run the D33 as fast as I would have liked.  I think 5:00 is achievable, but being more pragmatic, and taking the above into account, I will be aiming to hold 10 minute miles which would come out at 5:30.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->As for the remainder of the year.  I had been intending to complete 4 of the SHR championship races, but diary commitments mean that I am now unable to do so.  I have been trying to find a way to squeeze in another ultramarathon.  I think the Highland Fling in April is too close after the D33 and would also put at risk the Cape Wrath Challenge week in May.  I had also considered running the Cateran Trail in May rather than going up to Durness.  I think I will probably stick to my original plan which is to run the Lochaber Marathon after coming back from Spain in April, and then to head up to Durness with a tent for the Cape Wrath Challenge.  I have already entered the D33 and the Clyde Stride in July.  I will be entering the River Ayr Way Challenge (September) in the next week or so now that entries are open, and hope to round the year off with a revisit to the Glen Ogle 32/33?<!-- raw HTML omitted -->There are a few hill races along the way that I am particularly looking forward to.  Most notably the Pentland Skyline race, The Glenshee race, and the Scolty and Fungle Hill Races which are a little closer to home.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->2012 = Monkeys’ year of the ultramarathon…..</p>

			 <p>Well I have disappeared for a wee while following the GO33, largely due to a nasty and persistent bout of bronchitis.  I seem to have kicked that now, and have just been for my first meaningful run in 6 or 7 weeks with Steve.  We ran 4 miles on the Aboyne to Tarland cycle route, on a particularly hilly section.  I have had hiccups ever since.  Steve hasn’t…but he has barked a lot!  We have had a power cut for most of the afternoon here in Aboyne, but everything seems to be up and running now.  I have had to adjust my plans for next year as a result of my illness as I am unlikely to be racing at 10km in the next week or so, and it probably isn’t prudent to try.  Therefore my next race will be the D33 from Duthie Park in Aberdeen to Banchory and back on the Deeside Way on 17th March, which incidentally is my 33rd birthday.  I will post my planned events for 2012 in the next couple of days or so.  I have tried out my new Inov8 Terrocs today, and can only say that they are terrific with far better grip, stability and much lighter than the trail shoes I have been using.  Here’s to 2012.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Merry Christmas, and have a happy new year.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Lee</p>

			 <p>Well, its taken a little time to get my head around how the Snowdonia Marathon is going to happen, what with moving up to the Cairngorms in a month. I think that I’ve finally decided that it just isn’t going to happen this year, and so I have added the Loch Ness Marathon into the plan for the start of November.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->To offset my disappointment I am going to attempt the Glen Ogle 33m ultra at the start of November as well as the Frasrburgh Half for the end of November.

Indeed I think i’ve only gone better once or twice. The start felt quick, with a fastest mile of 7:11 which I think is also an in-run PB. This perhaps helps explain my overheating and slow second 5k. My post-run weight is also probably the lightest I have been since c. April 2008 at 11 stone 10 lbs, and probably puts my bmi back below 25. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->So I will take the positives from this and try to prepare well for the Newark half marathon on the 14th.

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Richard and myself left Saltaire at around 10:30am aiming to cross over Rombalds Moor into Ilkley, getting the train back to Shipley, and walking from there. Leaving Saltaire on the Leeds – Liverpool canal, we walked as far as Hirst Lock using the footbridge nearby to cross the River Aire and into Shipley Glen. Emerging from the glen on the road we crossed over past the farm and followed the path up to the top of Baildon Moor which although I can see it from my living room window, I had never climbed before.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->After leaving the summit of Baildon Moor we headed down to the road and through the golf course before following a horse training track around to Weecher Reservoir.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Leaving Weecher Reservoir we walked briefly along a very busy road before heading out on the long walk up Rombald’s Moor, walking first along a wall before crossing through it and walking diagonally away from it towards the path joining from the Dales Way through a boggy section. We pasued here for a brew and to eat our lunch. Pushing onwards we came to the Twelve Apostles stone circle, were we fired off a few shots and admired the view to Drachs. We carried on for about 50m to get a photograph across Wharfedale.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Leaving the path here we headed out to the summit of Rombald’s Moor through the heather. I believe there is actually a path that runs along the escarpment. After reaching the summit we headed back towards the Dalesway, but dropped off the escarpment earlier and headed diagonally across the Moor to rejoin the path lower down. This proved an error as the ground was very wet in places here. On coming to a cafe we followed the road down into Ilkley. We went to the station to check the times of the train, making the 15:53 train with about 30 seconds to spare. This walk would have been around 10 miles long.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>Looking back now my notes seem quite grumpy, but my memories of this day are somewhat kinder, a really nice walk in one of the more remote areas of Snowdonia in good company.  This was the last walk of a week staying at West Bromwich Mountaineering Club&rsquo;s club hut in Nant Gwynant.</p>
<p>I can only currently find my heavily compressed 800px wide photographs from this week - if any when I find the originals, I will reupload.</p>

<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>
<p>I did enjoy the walking, but there were several things about this walk that really pissed me off.</p>
<ol>
<li>Being accosted by unrestrained dogs at both ends.</li>
<li>Trudging through pathless bog.</li>
<li>Getting to the top, seeing the youth hostel just the other side of the hill but 30 miles drive away, and a lovely track heading up the hill from the youth hostel.</li>
</ol>
<p>In summary…. do this walk from somewhere other than Pentre-tai-yn-y-cwm.</p>

			 <p>Description and photographs of a walk on Moel Ysgyfarnogod and Foel Penolau during a walking week in Snowdonia based out of <a href="https://www.wbmc.org">West Bromwich Mountaineering Club</a>&rsquo;s club hut in 2009.</p>
<hr>
<p>Feeling much recovered from my exertions earlier in the week, and having gained much confidence from the day prior, Richard and I decided upon an attempt on the isolated Moel Ysfarnogod behind Llyn Trawsfynydd.</p>
<p>Starting at the head of the minor road from Glan-y-wern we followed route 9.2 in the Wales volume of the Nuttalls books. The weather was superb all day, and the only real navigation problem during the day was choosing the point at which to leave the old mine track that leads pretty much to the mountain. As it happened we had chosen the right track, but did question our judgement as we following the track around the south side of the mountain, but ultimately we reached Llyn Du. The route was quite straightforward from here, descending down into the col and then scrambling up onto Foel Penolau and on to its two summits.</p>
<p>The scrambling is light, taking an obvious gully to the centre of the the mountain, and pretty much whatever line you like onto the two tops. Much recommended on a nice day, you will have the hill pretty much to yourself as we did.</p>

We parked by Cae Coch, and followed a path through a field to the wall which runs along Tal y Fan, following that over a few false tops to the summit. The ascent of Great Orme was rather pleasant. We parked up by the dry ski slope, and the relatively easy gradient was rather welcome. The views over Conway Bay were first class, and I regretted not having taken the SLR with me.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Tal y Fan – 610m – Carneddau Great Orme – 207m – Llandudno.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

We descended to Bethesda with a skull collector we met in the wind shelter on Llewelly, taking in Yr Elen along the way.

			 <p>On our Sunday up in the Lakes Vickie and I decided to walk up Cat Bells, Vickie’s first Wainwright!!! We drove over to Keswick from St. Bees and parked in the car park at the pencil factory and had a general womble around the town in the morning. In the afternoon we caught the ferry across, having to get off at Brandlehow as the Hawse End landing stage was closed. We wandered along the shore to the bottom of the hill at Hawse End, and ambled up on to the first summit, and along to below the second. There were a few rocky bits that I wouldn’t fancy dragging my granny up, as AW suggested! I went up over the summit to make sure that it wasn’t too rocky, which it wasn’t, so we headed along the ridge dropping down from Hause Gate and back to the ferry at Brandlehow, pausing momentarily to observe the old mine workings which are mostly fenced in. We had to run for the boat both leaving and returning to Keswick, but were lucky to make both sailings. The weather was largely good, and we had an awesome day, the rain holding out till we were back on the boat!</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->A coach meet with WBMC. The weather never did quite live up to the forecast, although the wind and hail was suffiuce to make Jonathan, myself and Stephen think twice about doing the Cwfry Arete. We shot up to Cwm Cau from Minffordd, up the foxes path, which is a bit of a scree run, and onto the ridge where the strong easterly could be felt. We descended the foxes path to the base of the Cwfry Arete, where we decided the wind was too strong. Point of note – if Jonathan tells you a path is ok, beware! From leaving the summit shelter the remainder of the afternoon was characterised by my incessant bout of hic-cups, bouldering on crumbling rock, and drinking on Dollgellau.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

			 <p>A walk with John Edwards, from thew Patterdale coach meet with WBMC. We walked over Arnison Crag and then Birks Fell in very heavy winds on poor snow, and decided that we would not continue over St Sunday Crag. We traversed the side of St Sunday Crag to Grisedale Tarn where we had lunch. John located one of his Geocaches near the brother’s parting stone ( just a few weeks later he would discover on tied to his windscreen wiper!), and then he located another near Lanty’s Tarn on our return to Glenridding. Whilst I was enjoying a pint in the Traveller’s Rest, John was locating a webcam cache. Only three letters spring to mind O…C…D……….!</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t write any words at the time, but it was a beautiful warm day.  I suspect we parked roadside near Pen-y-Pas as you could back then.  We completed the Horshoe in the counterclockwise order, ascending over Crib Goch, and descending off Y Lliwedd.</p>
<p>From the photographs the summit cairn was a rammie, the Snowdon Mountain Railway cafe had been closed for at least a year, and was in the process of being rebuilt.</p>

We had opted to climb up the Table Top Direct Route (VD) on the Cwfry Arete, following the Grade 3 Scramble from the Table Top to the ridge. It was a really good day and climb, the weather was awesome, and a nutter soloed past us on what can only be described as very loose rock! I also did a fair amount of leading, including an awkward bridging pitch, and was very happy with progress so far. We didn’t get off the climb until after 5pm, so we didn’t make it to the summit of Cadair Idris, and arrived back at the car about 7pm.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Climbing with Andy again. Left at about 9am, and was climbing for about 10:30ish. The weather forecast was abysmal for the club’s coach meet to the Nantlle ridge area, so we opted for The Roaches.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->First climb was Maud’s Garden, a nice VD with a climb up the slab to a pronounced ledge, followed by a chimney move near the top, and then a move back out onto the face to climb for a further metre or so.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The second climb was Aqua, a VS 4c which Andy has led previously, and on this occasion we decided to top rope. This commences with a climb up the corner of the slab up to an overhang above. The key to the overhang is to layback to the left, with the right hand in a very good hold. This should permit the right leg to move up onto a good foot hold, and the left hand above the right hand. The climb up the slab is relatively straight forward thereafter.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Our final climb of the day was Rooster, a D that was to become my first lead. The first half of the climb is a smear up the slab to a large ledge. As this was very green, I opted to use the adjacent gully up to this point, as it was not possible to place any protection, and we were already a good 10m above the floor before commencing climbing. From the ledge the climb heads up the large crack to the left side of the face.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Immediately placing a wire in the roof of the overhanging section, I then levered myself up to the final problem. There is a very large crack, which ultimately I used for an arm jam. The main difficulty is that the wall bulges outwards, and the foot placements here are not great. Committing to the move, I was soon on top and bringing Andy up to an audience.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Can’t climb outdoors for a couple of weeks now – so back to Wolf Mountain <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Unitl the next time<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The perfect day. Parking at the ski centre Andy, Ian and I headed over to the Fiacaill ridge between Coire an t-Sneachda and Coire an Lochain, and I volunteered for the first turn at carrying the rope. The ridge is largely a walk up, but climaxing in a grade I/II winter climb, dependent upon the route chosen. Arriving at the climb we missed the start out to avoide a couple of large roped parties, but quickly climbed back up to the ridge. Once on the ridge we battled our way up opnto the Cairn Gorm plateau, with bright blue skies and white ground we didn’t care too much about the wind. We ambled across the plateau to Cairngorm and returned via the ski area! On getting back to the car, I realised that nobody else had taken their turn at carrying the rope Grrrrr!!!!!<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->In the pub that evening Steve Clarke took great pleasure in pointing out that we had missed the grade II section of the climb blah di blah di blah.

As it turned out we headed straight up Beinn Teallach, and returned the same way. The weather forecast had been horrendous, and our group was the only one to attempt 3000ft. We returned to the car to a chorus of “youl never stand at 3000 ft on a day like this!” and “you’ll never get a cloud free view from a 3000 ft Mountain on a day like this.

However, when Andy asked if I wanted to accompany him on another marilyn bagging day in his attempt to complete Dawson&rsquo;s list, I couldn&rsquo;t resist, although today was a tad more strenuous than I had banked on.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The first hill of the day was Moel y Golfa above Middletown. We parked near a house at Garreg Bank, the path actually commences from their driveway by a sign instructing you not to block their access route. We ascended very steeply through trees to gain a lovely ridge with a rather large memorial on the summit. We descended by the same route, although it was pretty steep, and I wouldn&rsquo;t particular enjoy it in the wet.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The second top of the day was Beacon Ring on Long Mountain. This was a short walk in from where we parked the car near Short Cross. We followed an access track to the foot of the radio masts. Finding the trig point was somewhat more problematic as it was buried in the forest.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->We proceeded next to Caeliber Isaf, battling our way through barbed fencing from near White Hall Farm. The bull beyond the summit didn&rsquo;t appreciate my bright red Berghaus base layer, and so we made a rather quick retreat back over the fence.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Stingwern Hill was particularly nice, if somewhat short. We parked up in a gateway north east of Llidiardu, and took a short walk through sheep filled fields to the trigpoint, returning the same way.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->If Stingwern Hill was easy, Upper Park was more of a slog. Parking up near Trefnant Hall in a layby, we headed up a very obvious track into the forest and out to the open hillside above. Heading back into the forest to find the summit I seem to recall avoiding an area of gorse. The summit area is actually in the field adjacent to the forest, and we returned via the fields, not re-entering the forest, and coming out at the start point.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Y Golfa was more challenging, certainly the ferns were higher than me! Parking up on the A458 after a junction with a local road, we headed on up the path and then battered our way through the ferns on the way from it to the summit from where we observed some people attempting to play golf with little success!<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->We parked rather cheekily in a farmyard near Grwnamlwg to ascend Allt y Main via a forest track to a walk up the ridge, and descended via the same route. The forest track was irritating and seemed to drag with lots of recently conducted felling works.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->We parked at the end of a local road for Rhailgwn. We walked along the landrover track, and ascended to the eastern edge of the trees. The cloud had dropped considerably, and I had left my coat in the car! Attempting to descend through the fire break we discovered it to be full of gorse, and had to enter and descend through the forest. We dropped out almost opposite where we had parked!<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Mynydd y-briw was even more embarrasing. At the end of the road there is a house with no lay bys on the road. Not fancing the extra 100m of ascent we turned aroung in their driveway, parked on a ramp on the garden, and walked from there, took about 5 minutes in total to the top and back!<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I felt absolutely awful on the sunday, feeling nauseous before even leaving the car! I decided that if I didn&rsquo;t climb I would only have to sit in the car all day, still feeling like crap. As appealing as 6 hours reading a Fire Risk Assessment manual may appear to some, I was nonetheless unimpressed with that option. In part this was fashioned by the fact that the weather looked fantastic, and I was still bitter about missing the super weather enjoyed by others on the Friday at Newtonmore.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->We had decided to find an alternative approach route on the basis of our views of Beinn Sgulaird the previous day, and opted for the traverse from Druimavuic. We headed up a good track which you can follow to about 600m, and I had decided to see how far up it I could get without throwing up! After about 200m of climbing we came to a very obvious fault line that led straight up on to the ridge, and opted to go up that way instead, as it was probably easier terrain than going straight up the face of Meall Garbh.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Up until this point I had been debating turning around every 10 minutes or so. When we reached the bealach, and I discovered that we were at 520m, I knew that I would not be turning around, and before long we were on the first granite top on the ridge. I probably did not know about the drops inbetween the tops, or had chose to ignore what I had seen of them the day previous. In all there is probably about 1100m of climb on this route with two very large descents and ascents before reaching the summit proper. I was appeased though by the fantastic views, and the terrain was superb.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The ice bothered us a little on the descent, but not majorly so, and before long we were back in Glen Creran.

The footpath on this side is rather good, and the sun was out over the northern corries. However I was feeling rather jaded by this point in the week, and did have concerns about my ability to complete this walk, at this point.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The walk in was rather better than the photographs suggest, although with the sun over Cairngorm it spoilt any pictures taken.

The wind was ferocious as was the spindrift it created. The speeds were gusting between 40mph and 60mph, and made progress exceedingly difficult. Arriving at the first top on Sron na Lairig at 12:55, I suggested that we should turn around as we would clearly not summit by 13:15, which was the turn around time that I had in mind. It was decided to pursue, and we spent a considerable amount of time cramponing up, immediately after a previous long break in which Ian had donned an extra layer.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Heading over Sron na Lairig we soon found ourselves at the col below Braeriach. With visibility drifting in and out, I knew that we were not too far away, and when it was suggested that we turned around here, it was my vote that decided that we should continue, and I chose to do so as I was now quite happily walking away in crampons, and really felt just that little too close to turn around.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->We summitted Braeriach at about 14:00, only knowing that we had done so when we began to descend quite steeply. Reversing we found the cairn, and carefully made our way down, myself more on instinct than the precision of Ian and Tim, but between us we found the route fairly well. Our footprints from ascent had been entirely obliterated by the spindrift.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The spindrift cleared as we descended, but only intermittently, before finally clearing at about 900m. We kept the crampons on far too long, only taking them off when we next paused at the col above the crossing of the Lairig Ghru. The numerous falls on the way contributing to another sore knee!!!! I was concerned by the 20 minutes spent here as I desparately wanted to get through the Chalamain Gap before dark, knowing that there would now be snow in it.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I set a good pace up the hill to the gap, and noted that I felt as fit as I had prior to my 3000s attempt in the summer for the first time since. We cleared the gap whilst it was still in good light, and indeed did not require the head torch to reach the car.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->On the Thursday I felt that my right knee was very sore and immediately abandoned my plans to walk every day. I went to Aviemore and then Inverness with Andy Brown, procuring Butterfield&rsquo;s &lsquo;High Mountains&rsquo; a book called &lsquo;The Black Cloud&rsquo; which details Scottish mountain accidents and is absolutely fantastic, in addition to a new pair of Marmot &lsquo;Borealis&rsquo; gloves. I was delighted to discover that as I have tiny hands I required child size gloves at half the price of the adult&rsquo;s!!!!<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->On the friday I also did not walk, and it turned out to be a fabulous day. I regretted this decision, as my knee felt ok after a brisk stroll up the road, but with retrospect it was the right decision. I&rsquo;m hoping that a couple of weeks rest will allow it to heal sufficiently.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

About two thirds of the way up we hit a path which led up to the ridge rather more gradually, and a short stroll took us on to the summit, along with the usual debate about which rock was th highest. I found Creag Ruadh to be much more interesting than Meal Chuaich, enjoying a good view over Allt Cuaich, which interestingly does not have an h after the c!!!!(Or at least not in Butterfield).<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

As it turned out we needn&rsquo;t have worried, following the cliffs from above, the top of Cac Carn More was easily visible, and a bearing took us without difficulty to the summit of Cac Carn Beag. We were disappointed not to obtain a good view, however we were grateful to be in a cloud that was essentially dry. Ian had his eye on a few of the gullies, but it was obvious that they were pretty bare on the tops on t&rsquo;other side, and there were large unstable cornice&rsquo; on our side.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Rather than return the same way, we opted to descend via Glas Allt, and past a rather nice waterfall.

Feeling fairly tired from the exertions of the previous day, not to forget 3 hours stuck in traffic at Stoke, I didn&rsquo;t feel great setting out.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I walked on the Saturday with Andy Brown, Peter, John Eadon, and Fred. The weather was a little short of abysmal, I don&rsquo;t think that any of us particularly enjoyed the walk. Andy drove to Fersit, which sits just south of Tulloch Station on the flanks of Loch Treig. We spent the majority of the walk in the cloud, and the weather was far too warm to permit the snow underfoot to be anything other than slushy. I was much happier underfoot though than I was on Beinn a Bheithir at New Year.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Leaving the car park at Fersit we made our way through some farm buildings, and after being castigated by the farmer for trying to use the wrong gate, we finally gained the hillside. We followed the stream up towards Lochan Coire an Lochain before heading up through a wide gully onto Sron na Garbh - bheinne. Battling away on the ridge in poor visibility we finally found the summit of Stob Coire Sgriodain with a little assistance from Andy&rsquo;s GPS. We then followed the ridge over the South Top, and down to the coll that sits between Stob Coire Sgriodain and Chno Dearg.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->At this point I believe that we tried to ascend from too low a point, and consequently spent a great deal of time pratting about with the GPS trying to find the summit, which we eventually did.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The descent from Chno Dearg is a rather nice gradual slope, and we soon found ourselves out of the cloud and below the snow line, and racing back to watch the rugby.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

Summiting Sgorr Dhonuill we turned immediately back for the bealach, having been the first to summit the hill in 2006. It was very slippery on the way down from here, and I certainly took my time. We ascended up Sgorr Dhearg where we met several groups who had ascended directly from Ballachulish, and on the summit Chris produced a bottle of Champagne.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->On descent we took the Ballachulish ridge, as that heading straight for the church appeared prohibitively steep from the summit.

			 <p>This article looks back over a circuit in the Berwyn Mountains, starting and ending in Llangynog, taking in Moel Sych and y Gribin on route.</p>
<hr>
<p>Went out today for a walk with Mike, Emily, their dog Jess, and Nigel. The weather was pretty good all day, although it was quite hot at times. Enjoyed myself thoroughly all day, although if I am honest my legs were a little tired after my exertions the previous week in Scotland.</p>
<p>After suffering a moment of temporary misplacement on route we arrived at Llangynog at about 10:30 and set off up the ridge of Y Gribin with great expectation. Ascending rapidly to the ridge we ambled along for a period of time over the tops of Craig Llywn-Armon, Pen Cerrig, Waen Bwlchymynydd and Hafod Hir before descending to the Militir Gerrig pass.</p>
<p>We paused for some time at the pass to each lunch before proceeding up the duckboard path to the point where I had joined it with Paul on our visit in <a href="https://lee-perry.co.uk/2004/12/28/a-circuit-on.html">December</a>. We proceeded to the Cairn on Moel Sych from where we took in the views to the surrounding Arenigs, Arans, Rhinogs, and Cadair Idris. The view over Cadair Berwyn was quite nice, unlike on my last visit.</p>
<p>Not so concerned about the prospect of ice today, we proceeded down the steep path alongside Llyn Lluncaws, and to Pistyll Rhaeadr. The latter being complicated by our position on t&rsquo;other side of the valley. Following the track along, it attains the Pistyll Rhaeadr Road about half a mile past the falls, which we walked back along in order to obtain a pot of tea!</p>
<p>Crossing the bridge by the falls, we proceeded along the path above the valley, taking a short cut onto the old quarry road, and then up onto the bwlch below Y Clogydd and down to Llangynog. Before returning to the midlands we dined in the Tanat Valley Inn, enjoying fine cuisine.</p>

			 <p>Traversing the Rhinogau in the clouds with <a href="https://www.wbmc.org">West Bromwich Mountaineering Club</a> from Pont y Grible to Bontddu.</p>
<hr>
<p>Another one of those days spent hidden in clouds, as the photography testifies. We left Pont y Grible at about 10 O&rsquo;clock, with a long trek in to the forest on the East of the range. We followed a very boggy path through the forest towards the Roman Steps, then we took a Southern path up towards Llyn Du. We proceed due South from the Eastern flank of the lake, straight up the northern flank of Rhinog Fawr, and continued directly over it, descending steeply into the valley below.</p>
<p>After crossing a small stream we proceeded South again, past the West bank of Llyn Cwmhosan, attacking Rhinog Fach from the steepest side (West), The weather was so crappy, and the climbing so intense that I put the camera away at this point. By the time we&rsquo;d summited I&rsquo;d had enough, but was committed to the route, as the nearest escape point was after the final summit.</p>
<p>The route from here simply followed a wall directly over Y Llethr and Diffwys, which fortunately were far less challenging. On the top of Diffwys we caught the led walk up, and I aborted the drop down into Barmouth there to enjoy a shorter, and more leisurely stroll into Bontddu.</p>
<p>Its two days on, and my legs still feel like crap, but next time&hellip;</p>

<p>Had a fantastic day out climbing Bow Fell from the New Dungeon Ghyll, and we have photographs as well! We set out from the hotel car park with a nice leisurely stroll to Stool End. The rain was light and intermittent, and remained so all day. The Band dominated the view on the way to Stool End. We passed through the farmyard and headed straight on to The Band. It was largely stepped, but not exaggerated to the extent that the Minffordd Path had been on Cadair Idris. About halfway up I realised that my new Platypus was upside down, hence I had been trying in vain for about half an hour to get a drink. As a much smaller group there was not as much waiting around as on previous meets, which made the climb less stressful.</p>
<p>At one point, quite high up on The Band, the sun came out from behind the clouds and set off the UV sensor that came with my new pair of Crag Hoppers, which were excellent and kept the little rain there was at bay. We had lunch at Three Tarns, despite me and Keith heading for the Climber&rsquo;s Traverse momentarily. I found all the rocks around the summit an aggravation, but at least they weren&rsquo;t covered in lichen like those on Cadair. We sat on the summit of 902m for only a few moments staring at the Sca Fell range hidden in the clouds. I had hoped to return to the New Dungeon Ghyll via Rossett Pike, but with time against us we decided to descend the path alogside the Rossett Gill and on to the Cumbria Way through Mickleden.</p>
<p>After a long walk with Langdale Fell to our left, we nearly wandered in to the old hotel by mistake. Realising our error we crossed over to the correct side of the river, and headed for the pub. Needn&rsquo;t have rushed though, as some of the others returned late, and they had the Albion on telly in the pub. Picked out loads of ideas for next time i&rsquo;m up there, should be a jolly.</p>

<p>It started to rain in Welshpool, and the weather just got worse all day. I got off the coach in Minffordd, and my base layer was saturated by the time I had clambered clumsily in to my waterproofs. It just seemed to rain continuously, the wind was absolutely mental blowing in from the East. You could hear the gusts bouncing off the side of the mountain before they hit you. It nearly had me over a good couple of times.</p>
<p>I really didn&rsquo;t enjoy the first part of the walk up the Minffordd path, it just felt like a long series of steps, and was a really difficult start to the day physically and mentally. The weather worsened as we ascended, visibility being particularly poor, probably down to around 20 or 30 metres at points. By the time we reached the summit of Craig Cwm Amarch at 791m I was shattered, and I couldn&rsquo;t even see into Cwm Cau, never mind Llyn Cau at its base.</p>
<p>Everything just seemed to get worse as we got higher, and it became so cold as we got higher that I continually steamed up my glasses. That irritated me to the extent that I went out the next day and bought som ski goggles so that it wont ever happen again (hopefully). By the time we had forced our way up to the summit of Penygadair at 893m the weather had closed in completely. We couldn&rsquo;t find the summit shelter which we had been virtually stood on top off, and our group had become too spread out, so we couldn&rsquo;t find each other either!</p>
<p>The shelter hut was full of meltwater, but I was just glad to get in and get some food. I was hoping for a McDonalds, but it was just wishful thinking. We probably hung around too long in the hut, and I was absolutely freezing immediately after leaving. I was much happier once I had warmed the water in my saturated gloves and could feel my fingers again. I now have a pair of gore-tex gloves that will (I hope) help to prevent that occurring again.</p>
<p>We descended down towards Dolgellau on the Pony Path. Once we had lost a couple of hundred metres of height the bloody sun came out, and it turned into quite a nice walk down, with excellent views to the north. We stopped at the Gwernan Lake Hotel for some beer, before taking a stroll past Llyn Gwernan, and into Dolgellau. Unfortunately I was unaware that my camera was not exposing the film, else I could have displayed about a hundred pictures of clouds, and Klik made me pay for its development. Sods. Enjoyed the day a lot more with retrospect than I did at the time!</p>

<p>This was my first meet out with the club, and had a wicked time. We started climbing at about 10:30 and headed for Raise, and hoped to go on to Helvellyn from there. There was snow on the tops, and it snowed on and off throughout the day, but never very severely.</p>
<p>We followed the track between Glenridding Beck and Screes to the youth hostel by some disused mines. From there we headed uphill northwards very sharply. With the much of the ascent behind us, we walked up a slowly rising path, past the skiers and upto the cairn at Sticks Pass, from where we turned left and had a slight scramble up on to the summit plateau of Raise.</p>
<p>Once we gained the summit of 889m we lost the protection that it had afforded to us from the wind, and it was very exposed up there. The temperature was about -6°, and the wind was quite strong as well. It became apparent that we did not have the time to tackle Helvellyn, and probably not the correct equipment either, with ground conditions worsening with altitude.</p>
<p>After a break for lunch in the shelter of some stones on the summit, we persisted in the direction of Helvellyn, but descending on to the path below. There were awesome views of Helvellyn and Catstye Cam, with Swirral looking fantastic. We descended the path beside Glenridding Common and Beck, picking up once more the track that we had deserted several hours earlier. We followed that as far as the Traveller&rsquo;s Rest where we had a few well earned beers prior to the long return journey south.</p>
<p>I later discovered that none of the photographs taken here could be developed. So I have replaced it with a new digital one, but unfortunately I have no pictures of a wicked day out.</p>
