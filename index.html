			 <p>Today&rsquo;s ride took in the 18km <em>Lindknud South Area Clockwise</em> route by Nick Holme Kjeldsen on <a href="https://lee-perry.co.uk/lists/fulgaz-rides">Fulgaz</a>. 🚲</p>
<p>Having been down in London this week, this was my first ride back after suffering from London germs.  As such I took it pretty easily, riding at about 50% of my threshold.  It did not feel too bad</p>
<p>The scenery is made up of green fields, blue skies, and yellow rape.  The picture is crisp and clear throughout.</p>
<p>The ride profile is flat, climbing and dropping only slightly.  Riding on Fulgaz the resistance is constantly changing, though smooth and well-synched to the video.</p>
<p>The video is great, and a good length for a lunchtime TT or FTP test - or post-illness recovery ride!</p>

			<h1><a href="https://lee-perry.co.uk/2023/03/25/trying-out-rouvy.html">Trying out Rouvy on a Chromebook</a></h1>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>The combination of high quality videos and gamification would probably make Rouvy my favourite virtual cycling platform.</p>
<p>The videos are not as strong as Fulgaz, and the interest factor not as strong as Zwift, but there has been one factor stopping me using Rouvy for about two years now - vibrating videos.   Rouvy probably has the strongest all-round combination though.</p>
<p>Whatever platform I have used - MacOs, iPadOS, and a quick ugh, windows, shudders, attempt have all resulted in the sort of vibrating video that would quickly make me travel sick.  The other bar to entry for me was the 100% realism, which though laudible was not really workable with a very highly geared Wattbike Atom - though the subsequent introduction of virtual gearing has resolved that.</p>
<p>I was so impressed with my wee ARM powered Chromebook that I decided to buy a properly powered one, and have been working through setting up a Chromebook as an easy optimized Linux laptop - <a href="https://lee-perry.co.uk/categories/chromebook/">project here</a>.  So I decided to put Rouvy on to see how it works on a Chromebook.</p>
<p>I was surprised, the videos look amazing, and the AR overlay looks really good too - far better than it does on either my iMac, or MacBook Air.  All of the graphical artefacts looked far sharper too.</p>
<p>The downside, is that all of the UI on the front pages is screwed, and the menu pages are not functioning at all.  Presumably as the screen is rendering for tablet.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve not tried to ride yet, so have no idea for example how many concurrent bluetooth connections can be held, though suspect that will probably all be grand.</p>
<p>I have completed a back to metal rebuild of my M1 Macbook Air in the last week, since replacing the screen  - so I&rsquo;ll try Rouvy again there but expect the video vibration and dodgy graphical overlays will still persist as they do on iPad :(.</p>

			 <p>In this article I run through how to setup Git and Github ready for developing on a Chromebook. This article is the third in a series of articles about doing geeky things with <a href="https://lee-perry.co.uk/categorihttps://micro.blog/post#es/chromebook/">Chromebooks</a> - from software development to retro gaming.</p>
<p>Setting up Git and Github ready for development are pretty simple, but amongst the most important setup tasks that you will complete on any machine.  Doing so enables you to version control your code, and to pull code from and push code back to your remote repository (in this case Github, though there are alternatives).  Really I expected there to be nuances, but in reality this workflow is identical to the process on the various Linux distributions or on MacOS.</p>
<p>Remember from the first article in this series, the Chromebook already had Git installed when when turned on the Linux development environment.  The first thing that I will do is to configure the Git user in the terminal.</p>
<p><code>git config --global user.name &quot;Your Name&quot;</code> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<code>git config --global user.email &quot;your@email.address&quot;</code></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I want to be able to push code to my github repositories and pull code back, so I need to generate an ssh key.  To do that:</p>
<p><code>ssh-keygen -t  ed25519 -C &quot;your@email.address&quot;</code></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m happy to use the default storage location, and I do not want to use a passcode with the key, so I just click return through the next three prompts.  The key is generated, and pictographic representation printed.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Next I turn on ssh-agent, and add the key to it.</p>
<p><code>eval &quot;$(ssh-agent -s)&quot;</code> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<code>ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519</code></p>
<p>If you opted for a different key identifier, you will need to remember to change the key idea in this code also.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I also need to add the ssh key to my Github account - so I concatenate the key to terminal ready for copying and pasting later.</p>
<p><code>cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub</code></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Now in my Github account I navigate through to my account settings, scrolling through to the access section.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Heading into the SSH and GPG keys section, I click on the green button to add a new SSH key.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Here I paste in the concatenated SSH key that I copied earlier, clicking the &lsquo;Add SSH Key&quot; button that will appear below the key box in the screenshot below.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Finally, having added the SSH key to Github, I finish up for the night by testing that it works:</p>
<p><code>ssh -T git@github.com</code></p>
<p>If the key has installed correctly, the same text as below should appear, stating that you have successfully authenticated, but Github does not provide shell access.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>A simple and straightforward walkthrough that is essentially identical on Chromebook to the process on other machines.  Stay tuned to see what I setup on Chromebook next, and if there is anything that you would like me to try to get working, raise it in the discussion section below.</p>

			 <p>In this article I run through how to setup Visual Studio Code on a Chromebook.  This article is the second in a series of articles about doing geeky things with <a href="https://lee-perry.co.uk/categories/chromebook/">Chromebooks</a> - from software development to retro gaming.  If you would like to find out a little about why, and hardware choices, please refer back to the first article in the series <a href="https://lee-perry.co.uk/2023/03/20/211016.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>There are a couple of things that you should check before you begin.  If you have read my earlier article, you will have noted that buying an intel rather than arm based Chromebook is important for versatility.
Run <code>dpkg --print-architecture</code> in the penguin Linux terminal to find out - hopefully the answer will be amd as below.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Next, my Chromebook came with python and git already installed - run <code>git --version</code> and <code>python3 --version</code> in the penguin terminal to check that both are installed.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>There are a couple of tasks that we need to carry out to prepare the environment.  First run <code>sudo apt-get update</code> to update the apt-get package library on the machine.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Then run <code>sudo apt-get install -y gnome-keyring</code> to install the gnome keyring package, which will help to work with secure data.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>At this point you should be ready to get started.  Head over to <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download">code.virtualstudio.com</a>, and download the correct Debian executable for your Chromebook - x64 if you do have an intel/amd chip.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Double click on the executable that you have downloaded, and the install modal should load.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>If the installation completes successfully, you should now be able to see Virtual Studio Code on the find menu.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Double click on the virtual studio code application, and you will now be at the main control screen.  If you have bought a lower powered or arm chipped Chromebook, this may take a little longer to load.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Next you need to prepare the installation ready for use.  First install the linter for the languages you wish to use.  Shortly I will run a brief python script, so I install the python linter from the extensions menu.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>None of the key strokes within virtual studio code will be working properly.  So (in your chrome browser) head over to <a href="chrome://flags">chrome://flags</a> and turn on the deprecate alt-based six pack extension, this will release the keys that will otherwise be reserved for chrome.</p>
<p>My screenshot button will still not work - instead click control+shift+find windows buttons simultaneously, and the screenshot functionality will open.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Finally I run a wee hello world script to say hello to the world.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>At this point I have a simple development machine setup on my Chromebook, and hopefully so have you.  Stay tuned to see what I make my Chromebook do next - I&rsquo;ll probably look to work out how to generate SSH keys, and link to my github account.</p>

			 <p>My Chromebook series follows my experiment using a Chromebook as a Linux based software development and retro gaming laptop.  This article walks through setting up the Linux development environment on Chromebook.</p>
<h2 id="first-of-all-though-why">First of all though, why?</h2>
<p>There are a number of reasons that I wanted to do this project.</p>
<p>First of all, not being on Windows is not one of those reasons.  I have to use Windows based environments most of the time when working for my employers, but otherwise have barely touched Windows in a decade.  I became so tired of maintaining ever sluggish machines and keeping malware at bay that not only did I remove it from my own hardware, I took the Wombles on a Linux Mint journey too.</p>
<p>That worked really well for the Wombles for about a decade, running Linux Mint on an old tower PC unit.  No viruses, no slowdown, no need to clean up and defragment their HDD every time we went to see them in Spain.  Until last year when the hardware finally failed.  Wanting them to stay on a low maintenance low risk setup, I&rsquo;d been planning to transition them onto a Chromebook for a while, which increasingly made sense given their Android adoption in the intervening period.</p>
<p>The main problem was, that I needed to be able to train them to use a Chromebook, and given that my own technology stack for most of the last decade had revolved around all things Apple, I&rsquo;d never used them.  So we bought a wee Chromebook for the wombles to use - their use case revolves entirely around Chrome anyway, and another for ourselves so that we could train them on how to set it up from afar in Burnley, in the UK.  Thankfully, most Chromebooks are as cheap as chips - the technology requirements for a computer that in many ways is based upon mobile and tablet architecture are not too taxing.</p>
<p>I was quite impressed with my little Lenovo Ideapad.  It was not a high spec, and though that showed it has been fantastic for doing all things browser based whether in the lounge or sat on a train.  I particularly enjoyed the quiet that came with not being on my M1 MacBook Air, which though excellent, is very well connected to the world.  So I saw the virtue in using a Chromebook to work online in a more offline manner.  I&rsquo;d also used the Linux developer mode to set up a basic development environment.  It worked, but I could not install everything that I wanted to - in part due to power and memory, and in part because I had chosen a model with an ARM chip structure rather than x86 (Intel).</p>
<p>Finally, my MacBook Air died last week after just 15 months.  Though it has been subsequently rejuvenated through a screen replacement (for a third of the cost at the genius bar), I had decided that I would not replace, and would instead experiment with a higher specification Chromebook, primarily using the Debian based Linux development environment.</p>
<h2 id="which-chromebook">Which Chromebook?</h2>
<p>So I opted for an Acer Chromebook 515.  It has a 256GB SSD drive, 8GB RAM generous 16&quot; screen and an 11th generation Intel i5 chip - positively overkill for a Chromebook.  Not everything I try to do will necessarily work, but this series of articles will walk through my attempts to setup my development environment, and more ambitiously to use it up as a retro-gaming machine.  Between gift cards and promo vouchers, this machine actually only set me back about £300/€350/$400.</p>
<p>If you are following along, and read the rest of the articles in the <a href="https://lee-perry.co.uk/categories/chromebook/">Chromebook</a> category to make sure that I succeeded, you probably want to buy a Chromebook with a modern i or m series chip of a recent generation for the best chance of success.</p>
<h2 id="step-by-step-setup">Step by Step setup</h2>
<p>So without further ado, lets begin.</p>
<p>First of all open the settings application on the Chromebook.  Scroll down to the &lsquo;&lt; &gt; Developers&rsquo; section towards the bottom of the left hand menu.  Once there, if you have a recent Chromebook compatible with the Linux Development Environment, you shouild see an option to turn this on.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Click &lsquo;Next to proceed&rsquo;:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Having turned on the development environment, choose your username for the Linux environment and the size of the disk that you will allocate to it.  You can change this up and down later, but here I&rsquo;m leaving 64GB for the Chromebook, and giving the remainder to the Linux environment - that is predominantly what I am intending to use most on this machine.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Finally, open up the Linux &lsquo;Terminal&rsquo; application.  That will open up the Penguin Command Line Interface that you will use to control the linux environment.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>run a quick &lsquo;python &ndash;version&rsquo; in Penguin, and you will see the version of Python installed on the machine.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll leave it there for this article, but check out the articles that follow in the <a href="https://lee-perry.co.uk/categories/chromebook/">Chromebook</a> to see how I got on!</p>

			 <p>Todays ride took in the 18km <em>Fiesta Island</em> route by Mike Nelson on <a href="https://lee-perry.co.uk/categories/fulgaz">Fulgaz</a>. 🚲</p>
<p>The scenery is a combination of tidal San Diego River, Californian marshland, and deep blue skies.  Especially liked the bridge at 1.6km in.</p>
<p>The ride profile is flat, climbing and dropping only to clear bridges.  Riding on fulgaz the resistance is constantly changing, though smooth and well synched to the video.</p>
<p>Unusually you will likely complete this faster than the ride author, making for some comedy movements when passing runners and walkers on the road.</p>
<p>The video is just fantastic, scenery superb, and a good length for a lunchtime TT or FTP test.  I&rsquo;ve given 5/5.</p>

			 <p>Todays ride took in the 13km <em>Arguineguin to Meloneras Loop</em> route by Walter Muller on <a href="https://lee-perry.co.uk/categories/fulgaz">Fulgaz</a>. 🚲</p>
<p>This ride is a typical Canarian scene, blue sky, with a deep blue sea and sandy hills.  Riding out from Arguineguin towards Maspalomas, you drop down to sea level at Meloneras before swinging through 180º to reverse tracks to the start.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The ride profile is rolling, climbing and descending but rarely flat.  Riding o fulgaz the resistance is constantly changing - though those micro adjustments are much more smoothed than the less frequent gear changes needed on Kinomap..</p>
<p>The video is just fantastic after a few months riding on other apps, the 4K picture is pixel perfect, scenery superb, and a good length for a lunchtime TT or FTP test.  I&rsquo;ve given 5/5.  Nice ride, but not blown away - maybe I&rsquo;ve been spoiled this week.</p>

			 <p>Todays ride took in the 20 km <em>Dénia to Sagra</em> route by Toumy Degham on <a href="https://lee-perry.co.uk/categories/kinomap">Kinomap</a>. 🚲</p>
<p>This ride is a typical Spanish ride from costa to campo.  The views are dominated by the green hills on the horizon, and the various fincas that you pass.  Despite the start along the beach, you barely see it.</p>
<p>The first third of the ride is flat, climbing slowly thereafter to the village of Sagra, nothing too steep, very rideable, and generally well matched to the video with little pulsing.</p>
<p>Good video, excellent clarity in picture, good scenery, and a good length for a lunchtime TT or FTP test.  I&rsquo;ve given 4/5.  Nice ride, but not blown away - maybe I&rsquo;ve been spoiled this week.</p>

			 <p>Workflow and templates follow for a small, routed, multi-page flask app - for MacOS / Linux based systems only.</p>
<p>First of all we need to set up the folder structure ready to host the project, setup and activate the python virtual environment, and install flask.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>mkdir flask_demo
cd flask_demo
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install flask
-m pip install --upgrade pip
pip list

Package            		Version
-------------------------------------
click				8.1.3
Flask 				2.2.3
importlib-metadata  		6.0.0
itsdangerous             	2.1.2
Jinja2                         	3.1.2
MarkupSafe              	2.1.2
pip                            	23.0.1
setuptools               	49.2.1
Werkzeug                  	2.2.3
zipp                           	3.15.0

</code></pre><p>Next we create the main program file in the root folder - in this case I have called it demo.py.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>touch demo.py

</code></pre><h2 id="demopy">demo.py</h2>
<p>demo.py is a very simple file that imports app from the program folder.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>from program import app

</code></pre><p>Next we create the program subfolder, and create two files within it.  __ init __.py and routes.py.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>mkdir program
cd program
touch __init__.py
touch routes.py

</code></pre><h2 id="__-init-__py">__ init __.py</h2>
<p>__ init __.py is the main application.  Here we import Flask, assigns itself within Flask to the app variable we called into the main program, and also imports routes.py</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

from program import routes
</code></pre><h2 id="routespy">routes.py</h2>
<p>routes.py starts off by identifying the routes or addresses within the application.</p>
<p>routes.py also imports the render_template module und uses it to render any html templates that have been stipulated against each route, rather than stipulating output directly here.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>from program import app
from flask import render_template

@app.route('/')
@app.route('/index')

def index():
	return render_template('index.html')

@app.route('/about')
def about():
	return render_template('about.html')

@app.route('/occupancy_calculator')
def work():
	return render_template('occupancy_calculator.html')
</code></pre><p>Finally we create a templates subdirectory within the program folder, and we create our template files within it.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>mkdir templates
cd templates
touch base.html
touch index.html
</code></pre><h2 id="basehtml">base.html</h2>
<p>We create base.html - we sets out the main html page structure that the app will use.  Note the jinja templating inside the curly brackets, calling in the content of linked templates.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
      &lt;meta charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;
      &lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;X-UA-Compatible&quot; content=&quot;IE=edge&quot;&gt;
      &lt;meta name=&quot;viewport&quot; content=&quot;width=device-width, initial-scale=1&quot;&gt;
      &lt;!-- load MUI --&gt;
      &lt;link href=&quot;//cdn.muicss.com/mui-0.9.39/css/mui.min.css&quot; rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; /&gt;
      &lt;script src=&quot;//cdn.muicss.com/mui-0.9.39/js/mui.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;mui-panel&quot;&gt;Menu Bar - 
            &lt;button class=&quot;mui-btn mui-btn--raised&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/index&quot;&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/button&gt;
            &lt;button class=&quot;mui-btn mui-btn--raised&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/100Days&quot;&gt;100 Days&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/button&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;hr&gt;
        {% block content %}{% endblock %}
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre><h2 id="indexhtml">index.html</h2>
<p>Then we create all of the other page templates - note the jinja templating again, first declaring the extension of the base template, declaring the block content, and then defining the content.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>{% extends &quot;base.html&quot; %}

{% block content%}
		&lt;h1&gt;Hello!&lt;/h1&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;This is the text we've included in our HTML files&lt;/p&gt;

{% endblock%}
</code></pre><p>Finally, we return to the route folder, and run flask.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>cd ..
cd ..
flask run

</code></pre><p>One extra thing that we can do is to install the python-dotenv, defining the app within the environment to speed up each launch.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>pip install python-dotenv
touch .flaskenv
env | grep FLASK_APP
flask run

</code></pre>

			 <p>Todays ride took in the 12 km <em>San Vittore Roveredo Carasole</em> route by SilvanoTurati on <a href="https://lee-perry.co.uk/categories/kinomap">Kinomap</a>. 🚲</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really have words for the scenery, its just phenomenal.  Deep blue skies, lush green valleys, tall surrounding peaks with the river Moësa for company in parts.  This ride really is something else.</p>
<p>The first 10km of the ride are largely flat, rolling through a couple of climbs as the ride makes its way from San Vittore and through Roveredo.  After the detour through Roveredo the ride drops back to the river, before almost 2km of climb at 10% to the Chiesa San Rocco in the village of Carasole.</p>
<p>The gradient profile is very rideable, it doesn&rsquo;t match the video exactly - but thankfully is not as terraced as my last ride.  For a perfectly matched gradient profile, you do really need to ride on Fulgaz.</p>
<p>Superb smooth video, excellent clarity in picture, great scenery, and a good length for a lunchtime TT or FTP test.  I&rsquo;ve given 5/5 - one of the best rides I have done on Kinomap.</p>

			 <p>Todays ride took in the 24 km <em>Maryborough 3 Reservoir Loop - Part 1</em> route by RobbieRensenbrink on <a href="https://lee-perry.co.uk/categories/kinomap">Kinomap</a>. 🚲</p>
<p>The scenery is a beautiful mix of yellow grain and blue sky, interspersed with occasion herds of cattle.  There is also a lovely scan of Maryborough&rsquo;s sandstone train station right at the very beginning of the ride.</p>
<p>The profile is rolling with 200m of climb.  Depending on the power you put down, this route should take you around 45 minutes.  The gradient profile is definitely out of sync in places.  I suspect that this is the first ride I have done where have noticed the more frequent gradient changes in Kinomap.  However, this results in a bizarre sequence of steps and plateaus that does not really reflect the video.  I know that you cannot pleas eall of the people all of the time, but I think I prefer either the hyper smoothed approach that you usually get on Kinomap or the constantly changing gradient of Fulgaz.  I&rsquo;m not sure I like this middle ground compromise very much.</p>
<p>The video is superb, great scenery, smooth though filmed from a faster vehicle, and a good length for a lunchtime TT or FTP test.  I&rsquo;ve given 4/5 - it would have been 5/5 but for the slightly weird gradient profile.</p>

		<a href="https://lee-perry.co.uk/2023/02/25/alcohol-and-substance.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2023-02-25 13:48:20 &#43;0100">Feb 25, 2023</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Alcohol and substance abuse is a sensitive area which can and does impact on the ability of employees to perform not only safety critical tasks, but also their core duties well.  This article looks at the legislative basis for drug and alcohol management policies and testing regimes in the workplace, from a health and safety point of view.</p>
<p>Like other people management topics as stress there is a confluence of interests in this area with the Human Resources or Human Capital Management function.  Similar to those other topics, this issue is not solely about what happens in the workplace either - with behaviour being influenced by a whole range of factors outwith the workplace that employers have only visibility of.</p>
<h2 id="the-law">The Law</h2>
<p>Firstly it is important to be clear that there is nothing written directly in Health &amp; Safety legislation on the topic of drug and alcohol management in the workplace.  This topic is not unique in that, and while this section will look at the legislation in this area from a health and safety point of view, there will often be direct statutory offences under other (ie road traffic / misuse of drugs) legislation with more relevant regulators.  That principle is important for the sections that follow.</p>
<p>Though there is no specific health and safety legislation on this topic, there is plenty of general legislation that does apply including:</p>
<ul>
<li>the general duties towards employees and others who may be affected by the undertaking in Sections 2 and 3 of the Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974.</li>
<li>to set out the health and safety policy and arrangements under Section 2 of the same.</li>
<li>the requirements to carry out risk assessments, and to make arrangements to implement their findings under the Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999.</li>
<li>it is also worth pointing out that employees also have a duty, to a standard of reasonableness, to take care of the health and safety of themselves and others, and to co-operate with the employer - the latter being especially important when looking to implement drug and alcohol policies in the workplace.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="section-3-policy">Section 3 Policy</h2>
<p>Section 3 of the Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974 is worded as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(1)It shall be the duty of every employer to conduct his undertaking in such a way as to ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, that persons not in his employment who may be affected thereby are not thereby exposed to risks to their health or safety.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of the challenges for the Health and Safety Executive is that Section 3 can be read so broadly as to extend to almost anything.  It could be interpreted for example as extending to road traffic accidents and medical negligence, for example.</p>
<h2 id="enforcement">Enforcement</h2>
<p>For this reason HSE publishes its <a href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/enforce/opalert.htm">policy statement</a> on Section 3, setting out where it will focus its efforts.  In practical terms this means that where more relevant regulators exist, HSE will leave enforcement to that regulator, providing technical expertise where necessary to support, or perhaps investigation health and safety breaches in parallel (with corporate manslaughter, for example).</p>
<p>This means that HSE would only exceptionally become involved in road traffic accident investigations, leaving the police to lead on the investigation and enforcement.  This is significant of course, as statistically road traffic accidents are both a significant source of workplace accidents in this country, and also a topic where drug and alcohol impairment is incredibly important.</p>
<p>That is not to say that drug and alcohol impairment is not important to HSE, clearly drug and alcohol impairment in safety critical applications is a significant risk factor.  Where impairment was a factor in industrial accidents HSE would need to consider the dutyholder’s approach to drug and alcohol management in their investigation.</p>
<h2 id="guidance">Guidance</h2>
<p>With that in mind HSE publishes <a href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/alcoholdrugs/">guidance</a> for dutyholders on the management of drug and alcohol misuse in the workplace that is centred around:</p>
<ul>
<li>consultation with employees on arrangements</li>
<li><strong>focussing on safety critical work</strong></li>
<li>setting out the arrangements within the health and safety policy</li>
<li>being clear about what you may wish to achieve from screening and testing</li>
<li>supporting people with drug and alcohol problems.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="scope-creep">Scope Creep</h2>
<p>One of the key challenges for practitioners revolves back to HSE’s point about being clear about what you wish to achieve on this topic.  Drug and alcohol screening detects not only impairment, but use, and often use that has nothing to do with the workplace, and that may even be prescribed.</p>
<p>So as health and safety practitioners we should be making sure that our drug and alcohol policies are proportionate to and focus on risk.  The organisations that we work for may want more expansive drug and alcohol screening programs to identify use more widely, of a broader cohort of substances.  There may be good performance reasons for that - but they have little to do with proportionate risk-based health and safety management.</p>
<h2 id="coming-up">Coming up</h2>
<p>I will return to this topic in a later article(s) to talk about implementation of drug and alcohol testing policies, and will propose that, done properly, drug and alcohol testing policies are not purely a reactive measure after the horse has bolted, but can contribute to the development of a healthy and positive health and safety culture.</p>

<p>The scenery is superb typical canarian, with deep blue skies contrasting against deeper blue ocean and rolling sand hills.</p>
<p>The profile is rolling with 211m of climb.  Depending on the power you put down, this route should take you under 40 minutes.  The gradient profile sis definitely out of sync in places, with climbs arriving slightly ahead of the video and vice-versa.</p>
<p>This ride is a longer version of the <a href="https://lee-perry.co.uk/2023/02/22/gran-canaria-playa.html">Gran Canaria / Playa del Ingles to El Pajar</a> route I rode from yesterday, starting slightly nearer to Maspalomas than Playa del Ingles, but carrying on through to Puerto Rico de Gran Canaria.</p>
<p>The video is great overall again, great scenery, smooth with no pulsing, and a good length for a lunchtime TT or FTP test.  I&rsquo;ve given 4/5.  These Black Forest Cycling rides seem to maintain a rider i the foreground - I like the perspective that gives, but not all virtual cyclists do.</p>

			 <p>Todays ride took in the 13km <em>Gran Canaria / Playa del Ingles to El Pajar</em> route by Black Forest Cycling on <a href="https://lee-perry.co.uk/categories/kinomap">Kinomap</a>. 🚲</p>
<p>The scenery is superb typical canarian, with deep blue skies contrasting against deeper blue ocean and rolling sand hills.</p>
<p>The profile is rolling with 183m of climb.  Depending on the power you put down, this route should take you under 30 minutes.  The gradient profile seemed slightly out of sync, with climbs arriving slightly ahead of the video and vice-versa.</p>
<p>The video is great overall though, great scenery, smooth with no pulsing, and a good length for a lunchtime TT or FTP test.  I&rsquo;ve given 4/5.</p>

<p>Possibly one of the most perfect videos that I&rsquo;ve ridden on Kinomap.</p>
<p>The scenery is superb, with deep blue skies contrasting against the deep red sandstone cliffs, with the Colorado River meandering alongside.</p>
<p>The profile is pretty much flat and depending on the power you put down, this route should take you around 30 minutes.  Not completely convinced by the accuracy of the elevation profile, which continues to run gently downhill, despite the 180° turn at the mid point.</p>
<p>The video is near perfect though, amazing scenery, well timed with no pulsing, and a good length for a lunchtime TT or FTP test.  I&rsquo;ve given 5/5.</p>

<p>I need to ride on Kinomap more, given that I have a lifetime membership.  While the app is very good, there are a couple of little niggles that frustrate me, sending me into <a href="https://lee-perry.co.uk/categories/fulgaz">Fulgaz</a> or <a href="https://lee-perry.co.uk/categories/bigringvr">BigRingVR</a> exile every now and again.  I&rsquo;ll probably talk about that in a future post.</p>
<p>I really enjoyed this ride.  I used to live in Fife until 2014, and this ride took me right back there, I used to ride a little part of this circuit back then too.</p>
<p>The scenery is great, highlights being the view of the Wallace Monument on the way out of Stirling, over the Clackmannanshire Bridge, and across the canal to the Kelpies at the end.  As Scotland goes the weather is pretty good.  The profile is broadly rolling, and depending on the power you put down, this route should take you 1h30 - 2h.  I did this ride in two halves, dissected by canine naughtiness.</p>
<p>The sky is a little bleached, there is a little pulsing in the video feed, and there is a little more movement than in more recent videos - but a really good ride, surrounded by great scenery - I&rsquo;ve given 4/5.</p>

			 <p>Understanding the stay put or defend-in-place evacuation strategy is crucial to understanding fire safety in purpose built blocks of flats in the UK.  This post explains, what a defend in place evacuation strategy is, what is necessary for the strategy to work, and the circumstances in which a change in strategy <em>might</em> be necessary.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h2 id="defend-in-place">Defend in Place</h2>
<p>Defend in place has been a central component of the design of apartment blocks since the post-war reconstruction era.  The concept is quite simple, buildings are designed so that each compartment, or residential unit is designed to contain a fire within the compartment of origin, and thereby away from the means of escape and other residential units for at least 30 minutes.  The residential units are provided with individual detection and alarm systems, the common areas of the building are not.  In the event of a fire, the occupants in the compartment or apartment of original evacuate the building, closing the doors behind them, raise the alarm, and the fire and rescue service attend, extinguishing the fire before it can reach other parts of the building or compromise the means of escape.</p>
<h2 id="why-defend-in-place">Why Defend in Place?</h2>
<p>So thats the theory behind defend in place, but what is the rationale behind it? The answer is really quite simple, and lies in the design of the buildings themselves.  The dominance of single stair core designs for apartment blocks or blocks of flats in the UK presents a conflict in the event of fire between the need for firefighters to scale the staircase with their equipment, and for residents to evacuation down it.  A defend-in place strategy resolves that conflict by holding residents unaffected by fire in their apartments, and reserving the staircase primarily for firefighters to reach the areas of the building affected by fire.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-needed-for-a-defend-in-place-strategy-to-work">What is needed for a defend in place strategy to work?</h2>
<p>For a defend in place evacuation strategy to work, the <a href="https://safetyfactor.co.uk/2023/02/07/what-is-compartmentation.html">compartmentation</a> to the building needs to be adequate.  There are two components to that - the compartmentation needs to be adequately maintained, and resident behaviour conducive, to prevent the spread of heat, fire and smoke earlier than intended.</p>
<h3 id="compartmentation">Compartmentation</h3>
<p>My earlier article on <a href="https://safetyfactor.co.uk/2023/02/07/what-is-compartmentation.html">compartmentation</a> covered off what compartmentation is, and how the compartmentation to a building can be compromised through the life of a building.  So we will not cover that ground here other than reminding of the need for service penetrations to be appropriately fire-stopped by competent contractors when works take place, and that effective periodic inspection regimes for the passive protection, fire stopping and fire doors within a building should ensure that compartmentation should remain adequate to support a defend in place strategy.</p>
<h3 id="external-wall-systems">External Wall Systems</h3>
<p>Another way in which the compartmentation to the building can be compromised, rendering the defend in place strategy ineffective, is where an external wall system has been fitted to the exterior of the building.  If materials with the wall system are combustible, and can be ignited from sources of heat within the apartment, then fire may reach other compartments sooner than anticipated through the external wall system and window apertures.  The fires at Grenfell Tower, and before that Lakanal House show this in practice.</p>
<h3 id="human-behaviour">Human Behaviour</h3>
<p>A building can have the best compartmentation in the world, but human behaviour can override it too.  The defend in place strategy depends upon retaining fire in the compartment of original, and maintaining the escape stair clear of heat and smoke.</p>
<p>Resident behaviour can impact the effectiveness of the compartmentation strategy in a couple of ways:</p>
<h4 id="fire-doors">Fire Doors</h4>
<p>Fire doors need to be maintained effectively self closing at all times.  In some scenarios doors may be held open on automatic release devices, though that is unlikely in a building with a defend in place evacuation strategy - where these buildings have common detection systems they are usually only used to activate ventilation systems to the means of escape.  So holding open fire doors is significant in two ways.  First, it damages doors and self-closers impacting the efficacy of the doors in the event of fire.  Second - fire doors wedged open at the time of fire may allow fire heat and smoke to penetrate the means of escape far earlier than intended - hindering firefighting, and reducing the window for evacuation.</p>
<h4 id="evacuation">Evacuation</h4>
<p>The same principles apply to the apartment front doors.  Where self closers have been removed, doors will remain open unless manually closed, and closing front doors in evacuating buildings is the least of the residents' worries.  So ensuring that the door furniture is maintained, and that doors will self-close automatically in the event of evacuation is again important to ensuring the ongoing viability of the means of escape.</p>
<h2 id="change-to-simultaneous-evacuation">Change to Simultaneous Evacuation</h2>
<p>Occasionally a building will need to transition on a temporary or permanent basis to a simultaneous evacuation strategy because it has been shown that the compartmentation is inadequate to support the defend in place strategy.</p>
<p>This has been a fairly common transition for many high rise accommodation blocks fitted with external wall systems found to contain combustible materials that could support the spread of fire.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll cover simultaneous evacuation in a separate article, though a simultaneous evacuation strategy has prerequisites that buildings designed for defend-in-place do not.  In particular simultaneous evacuation requires early detection of fire and warning <em>to other residents</em>.</p>
<p>The National Fire Chiefs Council produced the guidance document <a href="https://www.nationalfirechiefs.org.uk/write/MediaUploads/NFCC%20Guidance%20publications/Protection/Simultaneous%20evacutation/SEG_-_4th_Edition_-_FINAL_17082022.pdf">Guidance to support a temporary change to a simultaneous evacuation strategy in purpose-built blocks of flats</a> to provide guidance to dutyholders in making the switch.</p>
<p>Given the absence of warning and detection systems, a <em>waking watch</em> is likely necessary to provide early detection and warning in the first instance.  We&rsquo;ll talk about waking watch more in a subsequent article, but a waking watch consists of the manual patrol and surveillance of a building looking for the early signs of fire.  Its far from ideal or perfect, and very expensive.  For that reason the guidance recommends the installation of temporary or wireless detection and warning systems where the switch is likely to be for a prolonged period.</p>

			 <p>We headed down to Liverpool for the RunThrough Run Aintree event.</p>
<p>RunThrough run the <a href="https://www.runaintree.com">Run Aintree</a> event five times per year, with entry into the half-marathon costing £40 (2023) including event t-shirt.</p>
<p>The event itself is well run, and based within the stadium, it was incredibly nice to use permanent facilities, and not to have to use portaloos!  There was also an excellent though expensive coffee van, and spectators could just sit in the stands and watch their horses run around the course.</p>
<p>The half marathon consists of a 1 km dog-leg along the stands at the beginning of the race, followed by 4 laps of the course, which consists of a lap of the racecourse, and of an inner loop - all very obvious and straightforward.</p>
<p>I started slowly, my plan really was to sit in Z2, and hold on.  Thats pretty much what happened too, building steadily on a long and hilly Padiham circuit from the weekend before.  A slow start, with early toilet stop, after which most splits sat between 5:15/km and 5:35/km.</p>
<p>Run felt good throughout, other than left VMO tightening in last 2 km, before a fast finish.  I didn&rsquo;t push anywhere near as hard as at Fleetwood in the summer - so I was really please to come in marginally faster (though it was cooler).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/craftedbypanda/">Vickie</a> was out running today too, so it was nice to see here a couple of times heading through.</p>

			 <p>Compartmentation or compartmentalisation are concepts that are crucial to building fire safety in the United Kingdom, but which are routinely undermined and misunderstood by those engaged in installing systems and maintaining buildings.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-compartmentation">What is compartmentation?</h2>
<p>Simply put, compartmentation is the process of dividing a building into compartments that are independent of one other.</p>
<h2 id="why-is-compartmentation-important">Why is compartmentation important?</h2>
<p>Compartmentation in buildings is an important concept in fire safety.  If the building is constructed, maintained and used correctly, a fire should be contained within the compartment of origin for the period it was intended to be.  This should ensure that the means of escape remain viable for a period of time, or provide the assurance needed behind any &lsquo;stay put&rsquo; or phased evacuation strategies.  More on those another time.</p>
<p>When fire, heat, smoke and the products of combustion are able to escape the compartment of origin sooner than intended, the viability of the means of escape and other compartments in the building may be threatened sooner - with implications for the successful evacuation of the building.</p>
<h2 id="how-is-compartmentation-defeated">How is compartmentation defeated?</h2>
<p>To be usable within buildings, compartments need to be penetrated in a number of ways - these penetrations present weaknesses within the building that, if not properly controlled, may allow fire to spread to adjacent compartments.</p>
<h6 id="fire-doors">Fire doors</h6>
<p>It is necessary to move between compartments through door apertures.  To prevent smoke, heat and fire spreading between compartments fire resisting doorsets are used, the doorsets will be fire rated to a period of resistance.  To ensure that the doorset performs to that rating it is important that the doorsets are fitted correctly, and inspected regularly to identify deterioration in condition.</p>
<p>It does not matter how good a fire door is though - it will not act as a fire door if it is wedged open, and doing so will damage the door fit and door furniture.  Where there are genuine operational reasons to hold doors open, then using hold open devices interfaced to the detection and warning system, and checking their function regularly, is much more effective.</p>
<h6 id="service-penetrations">Service Penetrations</h6>
<p>Even in new buildings, services need to pass between compartments.  Examples include electrical circuitry, air movement systems, IT cabling, water, gas and waste distribution.  It is important that all service penetrations are appropriately fire stopped, using fire rated materials, by a competent fire stopping professional who is able to certify the works.  These service penetrations should be asset tagged, inventorised in the building O&amp;M manual, and inspected periodically for deterioration thereafter.</p>
<p>It is important that the same principles are applied to subsequent modifications to the building, so that as the building is updated and maintained over time, its compartmentation strategy does not break down.  As service penetrations are often hidden within voids, it is important that works are checked at completion and prior to acceptance to ensure that the building compartmentation strategy has not been compromised.</p>
<h6 id="windows">Windows</h6>
<p>Fire may also spread between compartments through glazing.  Internal glazing onto escape routes should be manufactured of fire rated construction.</p>
<h6 id="external-wall-systems">External Wall Systems</h6>
<p>In extreme cases, where fire has broken out of the compartment of origin through the external windows, it is possible that fire can spread over the external facade to the building, with heat and smoke impacting other compartments.</p>
<p>To summarise, the concept of compartmentation is central to the successful evacuation of buildings in the UK, on the one hand securing the viability of the means of escape, and on the other the assurance behind &lsquo;stay-put&rsquo; and phased evacuation strategies in certain buildings.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Building Risk Profiles are a fairly straightforward way of categorising buildings from a fire safety point of view, yet a concept that many fire risk assessor interviewees are surprisingly unfamiliar with.  This article provides an introduction to the concept.</p>
<h3 id="risk-profiles">Risk Profiles</h3>
<p>The building risk profile is a concept derived from <em>BS9999:2017 Fire safety in the design, management and use of buildings – Code of practice</em>.</p>
<p>The risk profile is a composite of two factors, the type of occupancy, and the fire growth rate.  So a building with the risk profile A1 benefits from occupants who will be awake and familiar with the building, and limited combustible material, where one with C4 contains sleeping occupants and large bulk storage of combustible material (Note B4 and C4 are not acceptable under BS9999).</p>
<h6 id="table-4">Table 4</h6>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Note that according to 6.5 of BS9999 automatic sprinkler systems provide an efficient means of controlling fire within a compartment, and as such the fire growth rate can be lowered by one level in the sprinklered rooms.  This reduction should only be applied where the sprinkler system has been installed to BS EN 12845 (new) or BS 5306-2 (existing).</p>
<h3 id="why-are-building-risk-profiles-important">Why are building risk profiles important?</h3>
<p>When applying the principles of BS9999, buildings with higher risk profiles generally require lower levels of protection, can afford higher exit capacity, and support longer travel distances compared to buildings with lower risk profiles.  As such the building risk profile talks directly to level of control required when applying BS9999.</p>
<p>We will return to this principle in much more detail in later later articles.</p>

			 <p>This article describes how building legislation in England and Wales influences the fire safety of buildings in occupation.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The Building Act 1984 set out the framework for Building Regulations to be made, and for Documents to be Approved providing practical Guidance.  Approved Document B provides practical guidance on how to comply with the functional fire safety requirements set out in the Building Regulations 2010, which were made under the Act.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="building-act-1984">Building Act 1984</h2>
<p>The Building Act 1984 is the primary buildings legislation in England and Wales (Scotland and Northern Ireland have their own regimes which will be described separately).</p>
<p><strong>Section 1</strong> provides the Secretary of State with the powers to make regulations for the purposes of securing the safety of people in buildings with relation to the design, construction and demolition of buildings, and the services fittings and equipment provided in connection with buildings.</p>
<p>It is these powers that allow the government to set out building regulations, laying out the fire safety design requirements for buildings.</p>
<p><strong>Section 6</strong> provides the Secretary of State with the powers to approve documents providing practical guidance on the requirements set out in Building Regulations.  Though <strong>Section 7</strong> makes clear that failing to comply with an approved document is not in of itself an offence, but in proceedings would point towards liability, where compliance would point towards non-liability.  These presumptions change the emphasis - where the defender can show that the approved document was implemented, the pursuer or prosecutor must prove that the law was broken.  Where the approved document was not implemented, the defender must prove that it was not.</p>
<p><strong>Section 15</strong> Places a duty on the local authority to consult with the Fire and Rescue Authority prior to relaxing requirements set out in Building Regulations in relation to:</p>
<ul>
<li>structural fire precautions</li>
<li>means of escape</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="building-regulations-2010">Building Regulations 2010</h2>
<p>The Building Regulations 2010 are secondary instruments made under the Building Act 1984.  Regulation 4 requires <em>building work</em> to comply with <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2010/2214/schedule/1/made">schedule 1</a>, while Regulation 6 requires material changes in use to conform to parts of schedule 1, including for fire safety purposes parts B1,B2,B3,B4(2) and B5.</p>
<p>Schedule 1 sets out the functional requirements for safety in buildings:</p>
<ul>
<li>B1 - Means of warning and escape</li>
<li>B2 - Internal fire spread (linings)</li>
<li>B3 - Internal fire spread (structure)</li>
<li>B4 - External fire spread</li>
<li>B4(2) - (roof only)</li>
<li>B5 - Access and facilities for the fire service.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="approved-document-b">Approved Document B</h2>
<p>The functional requirements set out in Schedule 1 to the Building Regulations are high level, goal setting objectives.</p>
<p>To provide a detailed means of achieving those objectives HM Government has published two volumes of Approved Document B which set out a design specification to comply with the functional requirements.
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/fire-safety-approved-document-b">Approved Document B (fire safety): Volume 1 - Dwellings</a>
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/fire-safety-approved-document-b">Approved Document B (fire safety): Volume 2- Buildings other than dwellings</a></p>
<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<ol>
<li>The requirement in respect of approved documents set out in Section 7 of the 1984 Act is to comply with the document at the time in force.  As such there is no requirement to improve the fire safety design of buildings as the specification strengthens within future editions of Approved Document B.</li>
<li>The law applies to new buildings, or to buildings when they undergo material change.  So again, unless there is a material change to a building, no requirement to upgrade the fire safety design is triggered.</li>
<li>For this reason a number of other guides and standards have been produced for the management of fire safety in buildings post-occupation, we will return to look at these in a subsequent article.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="degradation">Degradation</h2>
<p>Some proposed alterations to buildings will degrade or remove existing fire precautions.  According to Regulation 3 of the Building Regulations that alteration will be material, and therefore building work, if it causes B1,B3,B4,B5 (or part M, access) to be not complied with where it had been, or to be less complied with.</p>
<p>This is a significant protection - as it requires building notice and plans to be submitted for alterations that remove or degrade provisions under Regulation 12.</p>
<p>We hope that you found this explanation useful, please join the conversation below.</p>

<p>How looking for the best hosting and software options for one website led to a project consolidating most of my personal online and social media presence into a single website connected into the fediverse through Mastodon.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;d spent a little while prevaricating over hosting / design for a new project over at <a href="https://safetyfactor.co.uk">safetyFator</a>.  I&rsquo;d looked at various options:</p>
<ul>
<li>I knew that I did not want another bloated Wordpress build.</li>
<li>I like building in <a href="https://processwire.com">Processwire</a>, though for this project I just wanted to get on with content.</li>
<li>I also like developing in, and have built some fairly complex sites in Jekyll on GitHub pages - but again on this project, I just wanted to get on with content.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;d also investigated Ghost CMS which looks amazing, and micro.blog.</li>
</ul>
<p>I was particularly intrigued by <a href="https://micro.blog">micro.blog</a>, as I could see that all of the writers on that site had a Hugo website behind the scenes, a similar but faster static site generator to Jekyll, and I really just wanted to work in markdown.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d have probably opted for Ghost, especially if I had an established publication, but the cost seemed excessive on top of my existing hosting costs for a new niche project that may just not gain traction, so instead decided to give micro.blog a try to see if it could do what I wanted.</p>
<h2 id="safetyfactor">safetyFactor</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://safetyfactor.co.uk">safetyFator</a> build was very straightforward.  I opted for the <a href="https://github.com/am1t/microdotblog-anatole">Anatole</a> theme ported to micro.blog by <a href="https://micro.blog/amit">@amit</a>, set up the taxonomies and about information, and started writing.  I&rsquo;ve made some customisations to the theme along the way, but essentially that site was very quick to build.</p>
<p>It was during this project that I realised how closely micro.blog could be integrated into Mastodon through the activity pub protocol.  I&rsquo;d been rehoming myself on mastodon in any case - Twitter had been insipid and void to me for best part of a decade, Facebook I only really use for engaging in various virtual cycling communities/teams, and more latterly had been using Instagram more, as I just felt that my feed was more interesting, more geared towards what I actually read.</p>
<p>So combined with reading around content ownership and the Fediverse, I got round to thinking, how about if I also bring my personal website across to micro.blog, and use it to syndicate my short-form text, articles, static content, and photography across the Fediverse from a single source of content that I own?</p>
<h2 id="lee-perrycouk">lee-perry.co.uk</h2>
<p>I decided to experiment, setting up a second micro.blog subscription to use for my personal content.</p>
<p>This project was much bigger, and involved bring across several hundred posts, and maybe a dozen static pages, from my hosted Wordpress website.</p>
<p>On the whole the migration worked really well.  The posts came across seamlessly, bringing the media with them.  The images probably need styling, but that can be done over the next while - especially as I am planning to set all the galleries up to work in <a href="https://micro.blog/jsonbecker">@jsonbecker</a>&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/jsonbecker/plugin-glightbox">GLightbox</a> plugin.  Plugin setup is super simple in micro.blog too - there is a small range of plugins that you can add and remove directly in the micro.blog portal.</p>
<p>The pages were harder work.  First up the Wordpress post importer in micro.blog only seems to import posts.  I had to recreate the pages manually.  That was fine, it did not really take too long, though did involve lifting and copying in substantial html tables that contain hill lists, and my records of when I completed each.  I need to go back through the lists at some point, updating all of the urls.  The way they worked on my previous site was to search the site for reference to the hill/mountain name, returning relevant articles.  Once all of the lists have been updated, a similar experience will be produced using <a href="https://micro.blog/sod">@sod</a>&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/svendahlstrand/plugin-search-space">search-space</a> plugin.</p>
<p>Having lifted my website up, I decided to import all of my instagram posts into micro.blog too.  That was easy enough, though the official instructions for this need to be updated to direct to the correct export file to import.  Other than that though, it was very straightforward.</p>
<p>Moving from a Wordpress environment I lost the jetpack statistics that I have relied upon until now, and also wanted to move away from Google Analytics to take a more privacy oriented approach to analytics.  There are a couple of analytics plugins in micro.blog, though I used Clicky - inserting the tracking code into my custom footer.</p>
<h2 id="roadmap">Roadmap</h2>
<p>So at this point I have essentially consolidated my entire web presence onto a single website feeding out into Mastodon through micro.blog.  I have customised some of the theming to meet my needs, including adding reading time into archives and posts.  I still have some additional customisation that I want to build:</p>
<ul>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Separate archives for short form text and articles.</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Pagination in the photo stream.</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Categorisation within photo stream too.</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Continuing to finish rebuilding my original article bank, which had stalled even in the previous build.</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Rebuilding all image galleries in GLightbox.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="more-sites">More sites?</h2>
<p>Having successfully brought my main website across, and streamlined my writing workflow in doing so, I&rsquo;m left with a few decisions to make about some of my other projects.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://macretro.co.uk">MacRetro</a> is easily the most successful website that I&rsquo;ve ever run, though has been a little stagnant since I last had time to do much retro gaming.  Do I leave it where it is, bring it across, and either way begin to revive the project?  Much probably depends on how the earlier migrations work from an existing search optimisation perspective.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://insiderrr.uk">InsideRRR</a> is a Virtual Cycling project that never really gained traction.  Probably need to decide if this is a project that I want to continue with, and if I do, whether it just moves under my main domain.  To move across probably needs a better approach to mapping and metrics visualisation than currently possible.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It has been an enjoyable and productive switch so far, I&rsquo;m likely to consolidate more - subject to being able to provide more flexibility to the reader on what they see.  I need to think about how to structure that more before moving forward.</p>

			 <p>🥊🥊 Beterbiev v Yarde. What a fight, attritious and concussive from beginning to end.  Always felt like a fight that would be won or lost on a single mistake - Yarde allowed himself to be turned in to the corner 3/4 times on the front foot, and took a lot of damage in those exchanges.</p>

			 <p>Coming into force on 23 January 2023, Regulation 4 of the Fire Safety (England) Regulations 2022 required responsible persons of high rise residential buildings to install secure property information boxes in or on their buildings, and to check it at least annually to ensure that the content remains up to date.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Premises information boxes serve to make building and apparatus information readily available to the fire and rescue service in the event of attendance to the building.  The box must contain the contact details for the responsible person, and <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2022/547/regulation/6/made">Regulation 6</a> specifies further what the box must contain:
[] Floor plans for each level within the building
[] A single page block plan identifying the building and environ, and the location of the firefighting features installed within.</p>
<p>The legislation implements recommendation 6 of the <a href="https://assets.grenfelltowerinquiry.org.uk/GTI%20-%20Phase%201%20full%20report%20-%20volume%204.pdf">Grenfell Tower Inquiry: Phase I Report</a> which was published in October 2019, and following which the Fire Industry Association (FIA) and National Fire Chiefs Council (NFCC) published the <a href="https://www.nationalfirechiefs.org.uk/write/MediaUploads/NFCC%20Guidance%20publications/Protection/PIBS_Guide_06-21_V2.pdf">Code of Practice for the Provision of Premises Information Boxes in Residential Buildings</a> in December 2020.  So though the legislation itself is new, building owners and managing agents will have been aware that this change was incoming for over 3 years.</p>
<p>The guidance actually goes further than the legislation, suggesting that the principles within are also relevant to smaller blocks with addition complexity, to mid rise accommodation 11-18m in height designed to accommodate a stay put policy, and also to new builds taller than 11m.</p>
<h2 id="location-of-premises-information-boxes">Location of Premises Information Boxes</h2>
<p>Premises Information boxes need to be installed where firefighters can readily access them in the event of an emergency, and in close proximity to any control equipment that may need to be operated.  So in determining the location of placement, consideration should be given to the point of access for the fire and rescue service, and of any firefighting controls.</p>
<p>The guidance suggests that a premises information box is required per block, however notes that for additional boxes may be required at larger more complex blocks with multiple access points.  It similarly identifies that for straightforward estates with multiple mid and low rise blocks, it my be possible to install a smaller number of boxes strategically placed at the access points for the fire and rescue service.</p>
<p>Finally, for staffed blocks, it is possible to position the box in the concierge&rsquo;s room - supported by way-finding signage for the fire and rescue service.</p>
<h2 id="security-of-premises-information-boxes">Security of Premises Information Boxes</h2>
<p>The premises information boxes should be secure, with access restricted to firefighters by a copy protected key, and provided to the Fire and Rescue Service.  This helps to ensure both that firefighters can access the box in the event of an emergency, and that the information remains within and has not been defaced.</p>
<h2 id="signage">Signage</h2>
<p>The position of the Premises Information Box should be demarked with a &ldquo;PIB for Fire and Rescue Service Use Only” firefighting equipment sign conforming to BS 5499-10.</p>
<h2 id="emergency-response-pack">Emergency Response Pack</h2>
<p>In addition to the building and orientation plans required in the legislation the code of practice suggests that the premises information box should be provided with details of specific fire safety issues in the building, a summary of the building evacuation strategy, and details of residents with mobility, cognitive or sensory impairments.</p>

			 <p>Having inadvertently ridden Innsbruckring over the weekend, I was fairly confident that I could race well tonight.  At least as fairly confident as it is possible to be having completely fallen apart the week before!</p>
<p>Getting on early, I headed over to the volcano circuit on Watopia to ensure that I was properly warmed up in advance, averaging around 90% FTP across the 10 minute ride.</p>
<p>Dropping into the race I tried to hold onto the lead pack, and managed to do so for the first half a lap.  I missed the sharp incline up from the river, and it was too late by the time that I had started to crank up the power.</p>
<p>I spent the rest of the race trying to climb back as far as I could up the field, exchanging drafts G. Stewart, and then with K.Grant, before bridging to a larger group between 40th and 45th place.  That split a little in the approach to the finish, and despite a strong effort on the straight, finished 44/54.</p>
<p>On the whole, a big step forward from last week, and still a little room for improvement.  With a little more race savvy I should have held onto the lead group for longer, and a finish 10-15 places higher might have been possible.  Though an average heart rate of 179bpm would suggest working pretty hard, and need to race smarter.</p>

			 <p>On 23rd January 2023 the Fire Safety (England) Regulations 2022 come into force.  The Home Office has published its <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/fire-safety-england-regulations-2022/fact-sheet-fire-doors-regulation-10">Fact Sheet</a> on the requirement for inpection of fire doors, including flat front-doors, in multi-occupant residential buildings taller than 11m.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The requirements require responsible persons, more about who they are in a later post, to undertake:</p>
<ul>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Quarterly checks of all fire doors to the common parts of these buildings.</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> To use best endeavours to inspect all of the residential flat front door</li>
</ul>
<p>This presents responsible persons with two practical problems:</p>
<ol>
<li>Content of fire door inspections, and competency of resource required</li>
<li>Access to the apartment side of residential front doors</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="fire-door-inspection">Fire Door Inspection</h3>
<p>Here the government sets out that it expects visual only checks that do not specialist resource, or tools.  However, it then sets out the content of the checks required - which really need both tools, as a minimum a simple gap testing gauge, and specialist knowledge! especially when applying the additional information in the guidance to regulations <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/fire-safety-england-regulations-2022-fire-door-guidance/fire-safety-england-regulations-2022-fire-door-guidance">here</a>.</p>
<p>As follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A responsible person should consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>if there has been any alterations or damage to a door’s glazing apertures or air transfer grille</li>
<li>if there are any gaps around the door frame and that seals and hinges are fitted correctly</li>
<li>that the door closer shuts the door</li>
<li>that the door closes correctly around the whole frame</li>
<li>that there is no visible damage (either deliberate or from wear and tear) to the door or door closer</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="access">Access</h3>
<p>There will always be challenges in access to the residential side of flat front doors, given that residents may not be in, may be asleep, or may otherwise not wish to permit the flat-side of the door to be inspected.  In these circumstances the responsible person needs to record the efforts and communications made to be able to demonstrate that best endeavours have been made to inspect the door.</p>

			 <p>Iâve become increasingly good at getting training volume in over the last few years, without getting the results that I wanted out of that in terms of competitiveness and weight.</p>
<p>With two marathons this year and as many Parkruns that @craftedbypanda allows me out for, I need to be leaner, lighter and faster.</p>
<p>One of the changes Iâm making in 2022 is to maintain a food diary. Iâm using nutracheck, but plenty of other options out there.  I wonât achieve my goals by training alone.</p>
<p>Mainly to keep myself accountable while working next door to the kitchen, and to run a flight calorie deficit to reduce weight slowlyâ¦. also to make sure that I fuel correctly for training and recovery.</p>
<p>About 21lbs to go to a sensible race weightâ¦</p>

			 <p>Having wrapped up my racing year a week or so ago I wanted to take a little time to reflect on the events of the past 10 months or so before running through a quick debrief of the year from a different perspective perhaps from which I wrote at the time.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->As per the last couple of years the start to 2013 was a slow one for me.  Following the Glen Ogle 33 race back in 2011 I had contracted bronchitis which knocked me sideways for several months.  I had put this down to surrounding myself with grotty students at Warwick University the following week.  After the 2012 edition though I experienced very similar symptoms, culminating in my lying in a ball on the floor struggling to breathe on the evening of the race. I was not surprised to be ultimately diagnosed with exercise acquired asthma.  After all, the medication that had fixed my previous episode was not the antibiotics prescribed, but Salbutamol, an asthma reliever, which had also proved quite handy at allowing me to breathe after to 2012 edition.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Training started quite slowly, despite having obtained a ballot place in the London Marathon, and didn&rsquo;t really get going much until February.  Towards the start of the month I met up with my revolutionary new running buddies from the dark side of Kintore, hill repping away as much as my chest would permit.  Later in the month I arrived in Vietnam where, warm and dry, I put away a considerable number of miles on various air conditioned treadmills while also getting in a memorable road run out to and along the beach at Hoi An.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Vietnam treadmilling had put me back in better shape, although returning home at about 13st 4lb I was still far too heavy.  Training continued pretty well on my return to Aboyne up until the London Mararthon, not as quick as maybe I had run previously at times, but fairly solid.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Around a week before the London Marathon I engaged <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Karl Zeiner<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to coach me, and i&rsquo;ll come back onto this a little later.  Obvoiusly in the five days pre-London there was very little that Karl could do to influence that race other than to provide some reassurance based upon the data I had managed to get into Strava at that point.  Our race plan was broadly to head out at 9 min/mi aiming to still be under 10 min/mi by the end of the race and broadly I slipped a little from this, but not too much, coming home in around 4:25:00 on a day that I found to be quite hot.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Getting back from London my next ultra, the Cateran Trail was just 4 weeks away and at 55 miles was always going to be a tough ask given the previous 18 months.  Training went really well though up to the race, and although it was always going to be tough, and I wouldn&rsquo;t be setting any records, I thought that I could finish it.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Cateran race started ok, but I always felt more laboured than normal, but I headed through the first checkpoint at Dalnagair Castle just about on plan.  The road section after here I took pretty quickly, and felt quite good, although on hitting the trail it began to become apparent that I was overheating and feeling nauseous, symptoms I recognised from previous accidents involving heavy handedness and electrolytes.  I dropped into CP at Kirtkton of Glenisla about on time, but feeling pretty rough, and continued on after a pretty disjointed hydration bladder refill in which I could not get the cap back on properly.  I felt even rougher heading on out and up the hill and decided there and then that I would be dropping out at Alyth, none of the prolonged debating with myself which I had gone on to ignore in previous races.  I had replaced my electrolyte with largely water at Kirkton of Glenisla, and although I began to feel better on the drop into Alyth the weather began to worsen, and I didn&rsquo;t really fancy a long slog in the rain and wind.  So in short, although I&rsquo;d had a pretty rough and unfortunate start to the race, the main reason that I did drop out was that my head wasn&rsquo;t in it.  A bad day at the office, and my first DNF.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I had a couple of months until my next race which would be the Clyde Stride Ultra at the start of July.  Training continued to go well, and along with ongoing physiotherapy sessions, particularly on both tibiali, along with various attachments running into the right knee, I was quite optimistic going into the Clyde Stride, hoping to hold onto 10 min/mi throughout the race.  I hopped on the train from my hotel in Milngavie down to Partick on what was a lovely morning.  I hit the first leg of the race pretty hard, but I didn&rsquo;t feel too hard, but the middle section of the race from the first checkpoint, through Strathclyde Country Park particularly to the last checkpoint I found very hot, and very tough.  The last leg was little short of a death march.  There were some plusses from the race, in particular my fuelling and hydration strategies had gone very well.  Ultimately I need to run better in hot weather, particularly with some of the races planned for 2014.  My race placing too was much improved from previous races, but I couldn&rsquo;t help but be disappointed with my overall time, and my flirtation with heatstroke for most of an afternoon - despite my silly dessert hat.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The period after the Clyde Stride defined really the remainder of the year.  A house move from Aboyne down to Dunfermline resulted in 3 weeks without training, in part due to 14 hour round trips in a van full of materialistic possessions, and followed by a less predicatable bout of infected bursitis in my left elbow brought on by manhandling bookcases.  Ok.  It was predictable.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The loss of training at the point put my key race for the year, the Ring o Fire, beyond reach I felt, and so I opted to grab a late entry into the Speyside Way Race from Ballindalloch into Buckie.  Again hoping to hold onto around 10 min/mi I would fall slightly short of that, but overall the race was a big success, and but for a slow down between Fochabers and Spey Bay could have been so much better.  I was pleased with the race, and with a strong kick at the finish, but also a little frustrated with myself for time lost in the latter stages of the race.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->My focus after Speyside turned towards hillrunning with the Pentland Skyline race pencilled in at the start of October.  On the whole I enjoyed this, but my key goal for the remainder of the year was to run well at Glen Ogle at the start of November.  My goals for the skyline race were limited, and I missed my target by about half an hour.  Given the bad weather this would probably have been acceptable except that again it should have been so much better.  On this occasion I got my fuelling wrong, and bonked all the way up the final climbs losing oodles of time as a result.  However, this was never a race that I was going to finish, and given a bug-riddled September was on that I had thought long and hard about whether to start.  In the end I decided to man up.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I was not much better fortunate with wee bugs during October, and although when I was running I was running faster than I had ever run before and I was 1st 4lb lighter than at London, I was struggling to obtain the level of consistency that I had managed upto the Speyside Way Race.  This was in part due to illness but also business commitments.  So when Glen Ogle came around I knew that I could run fast, but was slightly pessimistic about how fast I would run. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The start of the Glen Ogle race went really well.  I dropped out of the forest into Kingshouse well under my 10 min/mi target, and arrived at the checkpoint at the top of the glen similarly ahead of target, and gained even more time into the drop into the forest.  I knew that I would lose a lot of time on the big hill at the back of the course, and so I wasn&rsquo;t too concerned to drop back to the 3rd checkpoint at 10:45 min/mi, knowing that the remainder of the course was downhill, and that I was planning to &lsquo;drop the hammer&rsquo;.  Sadly the weather came in at this point and I lost any power in my quads on the descent, ultimately slipping to 11 min/mi.  This was not the deathmarch finish of previous Glen Oglee 33&rsquo;s, but in reality the last 9 miles of the race was no real improvement either.  I am disappointed with the overall result, but also recognise that a better September and October would have probably delivered the step change in result that I was looking for here.  The result was a big improvement.  But again I&rsquo;m frustrated because it could have been better.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Therein lies the dilemma then.  In short I am disappointed because I have improved so much in training this year, but do not feel that my results show that yet, although on several occasions I&rsquo;ve been pretty close to delivering.  Running the skyline race in October was probably a mistake ultimately, and probably prejudiced Glen Ogle, but I enjoyed the race and it fits well with some of the big mountain ultras that I am hoping to race in future.  I also ran the hills at Glen Ogle far stronger than I have ever run them before - the time that I lost was on the downhill, and but for that my PB improvement would have been more like 1h30 than the 45min achieved.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->So, reflecting finally on what has driven my improvements through the year, there are 3 main factors - training, maintenance and nutrition.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Firstly, since I began working with Karl my training has a much more realistic but consistent edge to it.  Yes I still do long runs, but I also do a lot more shorter stuff, hillwork and speedwork, and this has helped me to better condition myself heading into races, as has much more back to back work and double run / double discipline days.  No longer is running about distance, its also about how well I can run that distance, and I hope that heading into 2014 we can replicate the gains made this year and translate them into the longer races planned in 2014.  On a personal note I find Karl very knowledgeable and enthusiastic across the ultra endurance disciplines, realistic, pragmatic and adaptive in planning, and sufficiently scary to keep me training when I otherwise wouldn&rsquo;t.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->My maintenance strategy has been much more proactive, and I have gennerally booked physio sessions post-race as routine, as well as identifying niggles earlier and getting them fixed before they impacted upon training more generally.  I have spent much of the year under the care of Richard Batho of Deeside Physiotherapy and Victoria Davidson although I also need to identify more local support having relocated to the central belt.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Finally, my wife Vickie has done a lot of work on my fuelling strategy helping to create (and cook) fantastic eloctrolytic flapjack which has helped to reduce my hydration problems since the Cateran Trail Race, as well as following me around and helping me at race weekend through the year, and this has also manifested itself in my slow but sustained move away from the bottom of the results table.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->2014 then starts early with a tilt at the Barcelona Marathon in March, where I expect to be substantially below 4 hours, followed by the Highland Fling Race, Devil o the Highlands and culminating with the Ultima Frontera 166 in Andalucia in October.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->As mine starts on 19 November 2013&hellip;<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->¡<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Feliz Año Nuevo 2014<!-- raw HTML omitted -->!<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

			 <p>This weekend was one of back to back long runs, to last 3 hours on the Saturday, and 2 hours on the Sunday, which I had planned to do on the Deeside Way and Tarland Way respectively. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The weather on the Saturday was very sunny and warm, with hardly a cloud in the sky.  I held a pace of around 9:20 miles for the first two hours, slipping to 9:35 by the end of the run.  On the way out I ran past two very distinctive birds with black tipped white wings and a bright orange beak, and the view on the approach to Ballater was dominated by Lochnagar.  The view on the return was of the aerial activity from the glider field. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I woke on the Sunday feeling quite nauseous and tired, opting to run on the Deeside Way again to avoid some of the hillwork on the Tarland Way, which was probably a sensible choice.  The weather was somewhat cloudier and far more humid, spending much of the run sweating profusely.  If anything else I think that this is probably evidence that my hydration is working better.  I opted during the run to knock a half hour off, but despite feeling ill the pace was good throughout, holding around 9:20 miles, and slightly negative splitting the return from just past Dinnet. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I had hoped to spend much of this weekend running up in the Glen Tanar estate, but time and illness prevented this.  All in all though I have to be happy with the two runs this weekend. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->There are plenty of positives to take: <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->1.

			 <p>I headed out with some friends today on a big mountain run.  Starting out at the Spittal of Glen Muick car park we headed along Glen Muick and up onto Broad Cairn, which seemed to have a series of false tops prior to reaching the actual summit.  We then headed quite quickly onto Cairn Bannoch and onto Fafernie before making the decision to add Tolmount to our round, adding an extra 4 miles onto the overall tally before returning to Fafernie where we split into two groups, one returning the way we had come down to the cars, and an advance party continuing around the horseshoe.  We headed up quite quickly to Carn an t-Sagairt Mor and dropped onto the bealach beyond where we had lunch next to an airplane wing.  We then contoured below the sister top picking up the path to Carn a' Choire Bhoidheach which we would have missed but for the rather obvious baggers path heading up it.  We had crossed several snow bands on the way which had sapped the energy from my legs somewhat.  We then rounded off the day with an ascent of Cac Carn Beag and Cac Carn Mor on Lochnagar.  I found the descent past Meikle Pap very loose and stony, and therefore painful and barely runnable for much of the way, and did not recover as much pace as I expected.  The weather was warm, the ground largely dry although I did soak my feet in a couple of bogs and in a burn at the end. I am quite tired now, so I will round this article off here, save for a few photographs below and the trip statistics:<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

			 <p>One last wee run tapering around Aboyne before the Cateran Trail race, which seems to have flown around.  In truth I&rsquo;m closer to being ready for it than I thought I would be 6 weeks or so ago, and my core mileage has been better and more consistent than before.  I&rsquo;m probably not quite where I need to be for this race, but am going to have a really good slog at it, and am fully intent on finishing.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

			 <p>Went for 4 x 800m intervals through Aboyne Castle grounds, with 2 minute walk break in-between.  Aiming for 07:20 minutes miles, the first three intervals were quicker than this, the last interval was probably about on target.  I&rsquo;ve given up trying to split the laps out on my watch, primarily because I&rsquo;m an ejit and keep turning it off instead of hitting the lap button!  Endomondo stats again this time, they show the variations in pace, although the Strava maps are prettier, so I&rsquo;ve turned on satellite view instead!<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I also decided during this run that Compeed blister packs are far better than the generics for running on, although the latter are fine for wearing around the house.  The run was also spoilt by the fact that my k9 children had unravelled about 20 of Vickie&rsquo;s wool embroidery skenes while I was out, taking about 3 times as long as my run to wrap back up.  If only I was a cat&hellip;.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Just one more wee tapered down run tomorrow to keep the legs working, and then its the Cateran 55 race en el sabado.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

			 <p>Well,  I&rsquo;m tapering down sharply for the remainder of this week, just keeping the legs ticking over heading into the Cateran Trail ultra on Saturday.  I took the beginners Jog Scotland group out at Deeside Runners last night for a 4x4:2 run:walk session up at Glen Tanar.  I&rsquo;ve embedded the stats from Endomondo for a change rather than Strava, I think that I prefer the Strava platform and widgets, but the extra information in the endomondo embedded display.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I also took a few photos up at Glen Tanar last night with my new camera which Vickie bought me for running with.  It&rsquo;s a Pentax WG-III which is an underwater camera and pretty much bombproof so it should be able to cope with the moisture and elements while running.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->  <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

			 <p>The second instalment of back to back long runs this weekend, I wasn&rsquo;t entirely sure how this would go and for that reason I didn&rsquo;t want to head too far from the house and so I did circuits of the village.  I had in mind that I would do 2 full circuits (about 5km each) and a truncated 3rd circuit, but as it was I ran faster than I had anticipated and so I did 3 full circuits with 5km splits of roughly 27, 28 and 29 minutes. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->This is a circuit that I normally use for runs of about half an hour, but opted to run laps of it in the Aberdeenshire sunshine.  It heads through the castle grounds, giving a view to the castle before heading past the village green, taking in the view of the hills, green and church before running out along the River Dee, and then climbing back towards the castle.  Had I realised that I would be moving so well I would probably have headed out to Glen Muick to do a circuit of the Loch in the shadow of Lochnagar.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The first hour of the run was fine, and I was moving quite well and freely, concentrating on maintaining good form.  I&rsquo;m conscious that as I tire my form fails, and then I tend to pick up silly injuries that relate to using a lazy stride.  The last half hour was harder, but not really any slower.  Again this run used a 14:1 run walk strategy which I am really happy with, and also as I said yesterday, surprised at the limited impact it has on average speeds whilst reaping the benefits of having a wee breather every 15 minutes (I am not excluding the walking splits from the data).  I&rsquo;m also finding it easier to stay on top of now that I have stopped trying to use the lap function on my watch, turning it off in error.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I have added a bit of a tagline to my header and to my <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Mission<!-- raw HTML omitted --> which sum up my thinking at the moment and what I want to get out of life.  I won&rsquo;t share the reasons why, but I&rsquo;m pretty fired up and motivated at the moment to go out there and just make this happen.  Any doubts about the Cateran 55 in two weeks have been put firmly to the back of my mind.  Failure is not an option.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I&rsquo;m now looking forward to some downtime as my next run will be on Tuesday evening.  Hopefully by then I will have freshened up, my legs will be moving freely, and my aggravated London blister will have healed.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Signing off until the next instalment.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

			 <p>The first of two back to back long runs this weekend, I decided to run up the Deeside Way from Deeside Gliding Club as far as a gate that allows you to cross the A93 into Cambus O&rsquo;May Forest from where I would attempt to find my way back to the car through the Burn O&rsquo;Vat visitor Centre, Loch Kinnord and Dinnet.  The other point of note is that this run utilised a 14:1 run:walks strategy.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Heading out from Deeside gliding club I was conscious that I wasn&rsquo;t running particularly quickly, and I was also frustrated by my watch still speaking to me in kilometres, which I don&rsquo;t understand, although I did manage to change this setting.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I made good time along the Deeside Way though, and steadily began to hold a pace of around 9:20 min/mi dropping to around 9:30 after each walking session.  I quickly found myself at the turn for Cambus, and debated with myself whether to take it, or to carry on to Ballater, as I was concerned by this point that I was likely to get back to my truck well before my 2:30 was up.  I opted to head in to the forest as this was a circuit that I had been plotting to do for a wee while, and one that I think there are probably other variants of.  The climb up to the forest was pretty harsh, and I stopped for a breather on the way, but I quickly reached the pass which was actually very waterlogged. Any navigational concerns disappeared when I saw the yellow arrows on the track that we follow in the Cambus Canter.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I then ran along a wet but stony track for a wee while until I came to a sign pointing downhill towards Burn O&rsquo;Vat and Loch Kinnord.  This wasn&rsquo;t what I had expected,, but went with it and sure enough dropped down towards the Vat on a track running along the top of a fairly steep ravine.  One small step would have been the end of this ultrarunning monkey.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I soon found myself at the visitor centre, from where I followed a good but intermittently surfaced track around Loch Kinnord, starting a couple of walkers as a flew past on the verge besides them, and shortly afterwards coming to the path heading out to Dinnet.  I found this track quite difficult in my Mudclaws as the ancient cobbles penetrated through to the bottom of my foot, but within 10 minutes I was in Dinnet, trying to remove stones from my shoe on the swing, which was quite a challenge.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sure enough I had arrived in Dinnet too soon, at about 1:50, and realised that I would be back at the truck by 2:10, part of this being to my not calculating the length of this route, and partly because I had run quicker than I had thought that I would.  I rectified this by heading out away from the truck on the Deeside way until the end of my run interval, and then turning around and running to the truck.  During this time I recovered most of the 10sec/mi I had gained climbing out of Cambus O&rsquo;May, which in itself I had been very pleased with, putting together some pretty handy sub 9min/mi splits in the process.  All in all a very successful outing, but we shall see what an hour and a half feels like tomorrow.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Climbing up through Cambus O&rsquo;May Forest<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Loch Kinnord<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Deeside Gliding Club<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

			 <p>I thought after a 6 month hiatus, that I&rsquo;d probably better update my blog.  The year has been a bit of a disappointment, largely as a result of a series of knee and ankle injures which all seem to have resulted from an over tight ITB.  Moral of the story: Stretch Lee you ejit.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I have been training pretty solidly now since the start of August, largely due to the fine work that Victoria at Aboyne Physiotherapy has been doing to my decrepit limbs on a regular basis, including some good work on my peroneous brevis and longus tendons which flared up after 21 miles in tarmac in my trail shoes last week. Hmmm, needed more cushioning methinks.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I&rsquo;m looking good for the Glen Ogle 33 at the start of November, and I have also been very lucky to secure a ballot place in the 2013 London Marathon.  To some extent it moves about my plans for next year somewhat, as it makes the Highland Fling race impractical and the Glasgow Edinburgh Double Marathon imprudent, just a fortnight before.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->So in short, I need to pick and choose my races with a view to getting into the West Highland Way Race in 2014, and applying for UTMB the following year.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I&rsquo;ve just been for a wee run on the Tarland Way today, put in a fairly brisk 5 miles in 44 minutes on the hilly bit of the track.  I also got slightly lost, heading 1/2 mile up a hill I&rsquo;d no need to be on.  Thought the view looked a bit different.  Och well, will be out tomorrow for around 2 hours in addition to doing some work on my LLB at RGU, and getting the house ready for our visitors this weekend.</p>

			 <p>After putting in a few 6 and 7 mile runs, as well as a few smaller runs and cycle rides, I set out on Sunday, not realising that it was April 1st, to put in a long run.  The plan was to run out form Orito to Agost, from there run down the road into Novelda, pick up a track to Monforte, before running back into Orito.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Broadly speaking the run went really well.  It seemed to start of quite slowly but picked up momentum during the climb into Agost.  I paused around the 9 mile mark to eat some food and take on some gel.  The electrolytes seemed to be working quite well, albeit a little too strong perhaps.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The pace carried on well from here most of the way down into Novelda at around mile 13-14, although my right knee started to hurt during this stretch and still does this (Monday) morning.  The views into Agost had been predominantly of El Maigmo, and on the stretch to Novelda were of the humpback mountain of Sierra del Cid.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Arriving in Novelda I picked up the wrong track for Monforte, which probably knocked a mile or two of the run, but by this stage (mile 15ish) the sun was getting quite high, and I was glad to have lost an extra 20 minutes in the sun.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I got lost, as I always do, on the way through Monforte, but did actually manage to pick up the right track to Orito, pausing in the shad on the bridge over the new high speed railway line briefly to cool, before running back into the village.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->All in all this was an exceptionally pleasant run with exceptional veiws, albeit a bit too hot at the end, and my knee hurts a bit from all the tarmac!<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Stats: 17.5 miles 2:53:49 2303kcal<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Splits: 10:38 9:35 9:25 9:37 10:03 9:52 9:51 9:44 9:29 9:48 9:48 9:39 10:0710:18 10:09 9:45 10:33 5:25</p>

			 <p>After a slow January the running is slowly starting to come back together.  A good 6 miles running with Steve on Thursday was followed by an 11 mile trot out on the Deeside Way today in the snow and on ice.  The pace was OK, not quick, but at 9:13 minute average miles was quicker than most of my prep for the Glen Ogle 33 and is also only around 5 minutes of the pace for my non downhill half marathon PB.  Not bad for my first run over 8 miles since GO 33.  I averaged a run a week through January, my two runs so far in February have already exceeded the total January mileage!<!-- raw HTML omitted -->There are times in January where I have felt that the D33 in March looked a stretch too far.  It has taken me far longer to come back from my bout of Bronchitis than I thought that it would.  That said I’m fairly confident after today, and the last couple of runs, that I can be ready in the remaining 7 weeks.  Albeit, I probably won’t run the D33 as fast as I would have liked.  I think 5:00 is achievable, but being more pragmatic, and taking the above into account, I will be aiming to hold 10 minute miles which would come out at 5:30.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->As for the remainder of the year.  I had been intending to complete 4 of the SHR championship races, but diary commitments mean that I am now unable to do so.  I have been trying to find a way to squeeze in another ultramarathon.  I think the Highland Fling in April is too close after the D33 and would also put at risk the Cape Wrath Challenge week in May.  I had also considered running the Cateran Trail in May rather than going up to Durness.  I think I will probably stick to my original plan which is to run the Lochaber Marathon after coming back from Spain in April, and then to head up to Durness with a tent for the Cape Wrath Challenge.  I have already entered the D33 and the Clyde Stride in July.  I will be entering the River Ayr Way Challenge (September) in the next week or so now that entries are open, and hope to round the year off with a revisit to the Glen Ogle 32/33?<!-- raw HTML omitted -->There are a few hill races along the way that I am particularly looking forward to.  Most notably the Pentland Skyline race, The Glenshee race, and the Scolty and Fungle Hill Races which are a little closer to home.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->2012 = Monkeys’ year of the ultramarathon…..</p>

			 <p>Well I have disappeared for a wee while following the GO33, largely due to a nasty and persistent bout of bronchitis.  I seem to have kicked that now, and have just been for my first meaningful run in 6 or 7 weeks with Steve.  We ran 4 miles on the Aboyne to Tarland cycle route, on a particularly hilly section.  I have had hiccups ever since.  Steve hasn’t…but he has barked a lot!  We have had a power cut for most of the afternoon here in Aboyne, but everything seems to be up and running now.  I have had to adjust my plans for next year as a result of my illness as I am unlikely to be racing at 10km in the next week or so, and it probably isn’t prudent to try.  Therefore my next race will be the D33 from Duthie Park in Aberdeen to Banchory and back on the Deeside Way on 17th March, which incidentally is my 33rd birthday.  I will post my planned events for 2012 in the next couple of days or so.  I have tried out my new Inov8 Terrocs today, and can only say that they are terrific with far better grip, stability and much lighter than the trail shoes I have been using.  Here’s to 2012.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Merry Christmas, and have a happy new year.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Lee</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Richard and myself left Saltaire at around 10:30am aiming to cross over Rombalds Moor into Ilkley, getting the train back to Shipley, and walking from there. Leaving Saltaire on the Leeds – Liverpool canal, we walked as far as Hirst Lock using the footbridge nearby to cross the River Aire and into Shipley Glen. Emerging from the glen on the road we crossed over past the farm and followed the path up to the top of Baildon Moor which although I can see it from my living room window, I had never climbed before.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->After leaving the summit of Baildon Moor we headed down to the road and through the golf course before following a horse training track around to Weecher Reservoir.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Leaving Weecher Reservoir we walked briefly along a very busy road before heading out on the long walk up Rombald’s Moor, walking first along a wall before crossing through it and walking diagonally away from it towards the path joining from the Dales Way through a boggy section. We pasued here for a brew and to eat our lunch. Pushing onwards we came to the Twelve Apostles stone circle, were we fired off a few shots and admired the view to Drachs. We carried on for about 50m to get a photograph across Wharfedale.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Leaving the path here we headed out to the summit of Rombald’s Moor through the heather. I believe there is actually a path that runs along the escarpment. After reaching the summit we headed back towards the Dalesway, but dropped off the escarpment earlier and headed diagonally across the Moor to rejoin the path lower down. This proved an error as the ground was very wet in places here. On coming to a cafe we followed the road down into Ilkley. We went to the station to check the times of the train, making the 15:53 train with about 30 seconds to spare. This walk would have been around 10 miles long.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Feeling much recovered from my exertions earlier in the week, and having gained much confidence from the day prior, Richard and I decided upon an attempt on the isolated Moel Ysfarnogod behind Llyn Trawsfynydd. Starting at the head of the minor road from Glan-y-wern we followed route 9.2 in the Wales volume of the Nuttalls books. The weather was superb all day, and the only real navigation problem during the day was choosing the point at which to leave the old mine track that leads pretty much to the mountain. As it happened we had chosen the right track, but did question our judgement as we following the track around the south side of the mountain, but ultimately we reached Llyn Du. The route was quite straightforward from here, descending down into the col and then scrambling up onto Foel Penolau and on to its two summits. The scrambling is light, taking an obvious gully to the centre of the the mountain, and pretty much whatever line you like onto the two tops. Much recommended on a nice day, you will have the hill pretty much to yourself as we did.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Moel Ysgyfarnogod – 623m – Rhinogs Foel Penolau – 614m – Rhinogs<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

			 <p>On our Sunday up in the Lakes Vickie and I decided to walk up Cat Bells, Vickie’s first Wainwright!!! We drove over to Keswick from St. Bees and parked in the car park at the pencil factory and had a general womble around the town in the morning. In the afternoon we caught the ferry across, having to get off at Brandlehow as the Hawse End landing stage was closed. We wandered along the shore to the bottom of the hill at Hawse End, and ambled up on to the first summit, and along to below the second. There were a few rocky bits that I wouldn’t fancy dragging my granny up, as AW suggested! I went up over the summit to make sure that it wasn’t too rocky, which it wasn’t, so we headed along the ridge dropping down from Hause Gate and back to the ferry at Brandlehow, pausing momentarily to observe the old mine workings which are mostly fenced in. We had to run for the boat both leaving and returning to Keswick, but were lucky to make both sailings. The weather was largely good, and we had an awesome day, the rain holding out till we were back on the boat!</p>

We traversed the side of St Sunday Crag to Grisedale Tarn where we had lunch. John located one of his Geocaches near the brother’s parting stone ( just a few weeks later he would discover on tied to his windscreen wiper!), and then he located another near Lanty’s Tarn on our return to Glenridding.

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Climbing with Andy again. Left at about 9am, and was climbing for about 10:30ish. The weather forecast was abysmal for the club’s coach meet to the Nantlle ridge area, so we opted for The Roaches.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->First climb was Maud’s Garden, a nice VD with a climb up the slab to a pronounced ledge, followed by a chimney move near the top, and then a move back out onto the face to climb for a further metre or so.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The second climb was Aqua, a VS 4c which Andy has led previously, and on this occasion we decided to top rope. This commences with a climb up the corner of the slab up to an overhang above. The key to the overhang is to layback to the left, with the right hand in a very good hold. This should permit the right leg to move up onto a good foot hold, and the left hand above the right hand. The climb up the slab is relatively straight forward thereafter.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Our final climb of the day was Rooster, a D that was to become my first lead. The first half of the climb is a smear up the slab to a large ledge. As this was very green, I opted to use the adjacent gully up to this point, as it was not possible to place any protection, and we were already a good 10m above the floor before commencing climbing. From the ledge the climb heads up the large crack to the left side of the face.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Immediately placing a wire in the roof of the overhanging section, I then levered myself up to the final problem. There is a very large crack, which ultimately I used for an arm jam. The main difficulty is that the wall bulges outwards, and the foot placements here are not great. Committing to the move, I was soon on top and bringing Andy up to an audience.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Can’t climb outdoors for a couple of weeks now – so back to Wolf Mountain <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Unitl the next time<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

The ridge is largely a walk up, but climaxing in a grade I/II winter climb, dependent upon the route chosen. Arriving at the climb we missed the start out to avoide a couple of large roped parties, but quickly climbed back up to the ridge. Once on the ridge we battled our way up opnto the Cairn Gorm plateau, with bright blue skies and white ground we didn’t care too much about the wind. We ambled across the plateau to Cairngorm and returned via the ski area! On getting back to the car, I realised that nobody else had taken their turn at carrying the rope Grrrrr!!!!!<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->In the pub that evening Steve Clarke took great pleasure in pointing out that we had missed the grade II section of the climb blah di blah di blah.

I struggled more than I would have liked, but it was the first major mountain walk since my return from injury carrying and wearing full winter gear.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->  Dropped off at Capel, a group of about eight of us headed up the Ogwen Road, I would spend most of the day with Andy and Darren, and headed off on the track passing through Tal-y-waun. From here the ridge of Pen Llithrig-y-wrach is very obvious. I was already fading a little, but made good pace to the top, and enjoyed a rest waiting for the others. It was here that Bob made contact with somebody on Whernside with his radio, the first time I have known him succesfully contact anybody.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->  I descended very quickly to Llyn Cowlyd, but decided to wait here and join the slower half of the group. This was a good call, as the ascent of Creigiau Gleision was very arduous, and one did not feel too well. On attaining the ridge we broke for food befor visiting the north top, then the true summit, and descending via Craiglwyn and Craig Wen. The latter of which was notable, as we had to scramble to its summit, although it would have been possible not to do so had we felt so inclined.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->  The walk out was long, and I was glad that the Bryn Tyrch was shut, as we did not have time for a pint, arriving less than a minute before the coach!<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

			 <p>The club&rsquo;s New Year meet was very good socially, although the weather was a bit of a washout! We headed north in a ciruit from Llangorse through very muddy fields and in heavy rain and high winds.

			 <p>Despite the fact that I didn&rsquo;t go to Elbrus, I was invited on the Elbrus Reunion, which was a very beery weekend. The photographs show a smash and grab raid on Allt-fawr on the Saturday - as the drinkers amongst us were a little dishevelled by their 6am heads down. After Fred had finished throwing up over a wall on the Crimea Pass we headed straight up to Allt-fawr following the ridge along. We had great views from the summit, despite the overcast weather. We returned via a similiar route, but descended below the ridge to gain some variation.</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I had been suffering from a poorly knee of late. I believe that I am suffering from a condition known as &lsquo;runner&rsquo;s knee&rsquo;. This is essentially a precursor to chondromalacia and caused by a disbalance between strength of hamstrings and quadriceps. Seeing as though my quads have wasted I&rsquo;m currently trying to rebuild them! However, when Andy asked if I wanted to accompany him on another marilyn bagging day in his attempt to complete Dawson&rsquo;s list, I couldn&rsquo;t resist, although today was a tad more strenuous than I had banked on.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The first hill of the day was Moel y Golfa above Middletown. We parked near a house at Garreg Bank, the path actually commences from their driveway by a sign instructing you not to block their access route. We ascended very steeply through trees to gain a lovely ridge with a rather large memorial on the summit. We descended by the same route, although it was pretty steep, and I wouldn&rsquo;t particular enjoy it in the wet.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The second top of the day was Beacon Ring on Long Mountain. This was a short walk in from where we parked the car near Short Cross. We followed an access track to the foot of the radio masts. Finding the trig point was somewhat more problematic as it was buried in the forest.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->We proceeded next to Caeliber Isaf, battling our way through barbed fencing from near White Hall Farm. The bull beyond the summit didn&rsquo;t appreciate my bright red Berghaus base layer, and so we made a rather quick retreat back over the fence.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Stingwern Hill was particularly nice, if somewhat short. We parked up in a gateway north east of Llidiardu, and took a short walk through sheep filled fields to the trigpoint, returning the same way.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->If Stingwern Hill was easy, Upper Park was more of a slog. Parking up near Trefnant Hall in a layby, we headed up a very obvious track into the forest and out to the open hillside above. Heading back into the forest to find the summit I seem to recall avoiding an area of gorse. The summit area is actually in the field adjacent to the forest, and we returned via the fields, not re-entering the forest, and coming out at the start point.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Y Golfa was more challenging, certainly the ferns were higher than me! Parking up on the A458 after a junction with a local road, we headed on up the path and then battered our way through the ferns on the way from it to the summit from where we observed some people attempting to play golf with little success!<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->We parked rather cheekily in a farmyard near Grwnamlwg to ascend Allt y Main via a forest track to a walk up the ridge, and descended via the same route. The forest track was irritating and seemed to drag with lots of recently conducted felling works.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->We parked at the end of a local road for Rhailgwn. We walked along the landrover track, and ascended to the eastern edge of the trees. The cloud had dropped considerably, and I had left my coat in the car! Attempting to descend through the fire break we discovered it to be full of gorse, and had to enter and descend through the forest. We dropped out almost opposite where we had parked!<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Mynydd y-briw was even more embarrasing. At the end of the road there is a house with no lay bys on the road. Not fancing the extra 100m of ascent we turned aroung in their driveway, parked on a ramp on the garden, and walked from there, took about 5 minutes in total to the top and back!<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I felt absolutely awful on the sunday, feeling nauseous before even leaving the car! I decided that if I didn&rsquo;t climb I would only have to sit in the car all day, still feeling like crap. As appealing as 6 hours reading a Fire Risk Assessment manual may appear to some, I was nonetheless unimpressed with that option. In part this was fashioned by the fact that the weather looked fantastic, and I was still bitter about missing the super weather enjoyed by others on the Friday at Newtonmore.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->We had decided to find an alternative approach route on the basis of our views of Beinn Sgulaird the previous day, and opted for the traverse from Druimavuic. We headed up a good track which you can follow to about 600m, and I had decided to see how far up it I could get without throwing up! After about 200m of climbing we came to a very obvious fault line that led straight up on to the ridge, and opted to go up that way instead, as it was probably easier terrain than going straight up the face of Meall Garbh.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Up until this point I had been debating turning around every 10 minutes or so. When we reached the bealach, and I discovered that we were at 520m, I knew that I would not be turning around, and before long we were on the first granite top on the ridge. I probably did not know about the drops inbetween the tops, or had chose to ignore what I had seen of them the day previous. In all there is probably about 1100m of climb on this route with two very large descents and ascents before reaching the summit proper. I was appeased though by the fantastic views, and the terrain was superb.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The ice bothered us a little on the descent, but not majorly so, and before long we were back in Glen Creran. I had felt ok up until that point, but felt awful trudging back to the car from here, and it was only really when we reached the M6 that I stopped feeling unbelievably sick. I was thankful when Andy run out of diesel and had to stop at Stafford services, as I had been crossing my legs since we passed Hamilton services considerably earlier in the evening.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->One of my main ambitions for this week (as it had been the previous year) was to &lsquo;do&rsquo; Braeriach. On this occasion I was to have an attempt with Tim and Ian.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ian had sworn me to secrecy the previous evening to restrict the size of the group, and at breakfast I was insisting that I was having a rest day despite having the salopettes and boots on, and having been seen by at least 10 people putting the sac in the car!!!<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->We didn&rsquo;t leave as early as we had intended, and this did have a bearing on the rest of the day. Parking up at the Sugarbowl about 0915 we proceeded along the footpath that ultimately leads to the Chalamain Gap. The footpath on this side is rather good, and the sun was out over the northern corries. However I was feeling rather jaded by this point in the week, and did have concerns about my ability to complete this walk, at this point.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The walk in was rather better than the photographs suggest, although with the sun over Cairngorm it spoilt any pictures taken. The gap was both dry and free from snow, and we were soon heartbreakingly descending into the Lairig Ghru.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Crossing the burn we were soon ascending along the long ridge of Sron na Lairig, and before long into the cloud. The wind was ferocious as was the spindrift it created. The speeds were gusting between 40mph and 60mph, and made progress exceedingly difficult. Arriving at the first top on Sron na Lairig at 12:55, I suggested that we should turn around as we would clearly not summit by 13:15, which was the turn around time that I had in mind. It was decided to pursue, and we spent a considerable amount of time cramponing up, immediately after a previous long break in which Ian had donned an extra layer.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Heading over Sron na Lairig we soon found ourselves at the col below Braeriach. With visibility drifting in and out, I knew that we were not too far away, and when it was suggested that we turned around here, it was my vote that decided that we should continue, and I chose to do so as I was now quite happily walking away in crampons, and really felt just that little too close to turn around.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->We summitted Braeriach at about 14:00, only knowing that we had done so when we began to descend quite steeply. Reversing we found the cairn, and carefully made our way down, myself more on instinct than the precision of Ian and Tim, but between us we found the route fairly well. Our footprints from ascent had been entirely obliterated by the spindrift.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The spindrift cleared as we descended, but only intermittently, before finally clearing at about 900m. We kept the crampons on far too long, only taking them off when we next paused at the col above the crossing of the Lairig Ghru. The numerous falls on the way contributing to another sore knee!!!! I was concerned by the 20 minutes spent here as I desparately wanted to get through the Chalamain Gap before dark, knowing that there would now be snow in it.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I set a good pace up the hill to the gap, and noted that I felt as fit as I had prior to my 3000s attempt in the summer for the first time since. We cleared the gap whilst it was still in good light, and indeed did not require the head torch to reach the car.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->On the Thursday I felt that my right knee was very sore and immediately abandoned my plans to walk every day. I went to Aviemore and then Inverness with Andy Brown, procuring Butterfield&rsquo;s &lsquo;High Mountains&rsquo; a book called &lsquo;The Black Cloud&rsquo; which details Scottish mountain accidents and is absolutely fantastic, in addition to a new pair of Marmot &lsquo;Borealis&rsquo; gloves. I was delighted to discover that as I have tiny hands I required child size gloves at half the price of the adult&rsquo;s!!!!<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->On the friday I also did not walk, and it turned out to be a fabulous day. I regretted this decision, as my knee felt ok after a brisk stroll up the road, but with retrospect it was the right decision. I&rsquo;m hoping that a couple of weeks rest will allow it to heal sufficiently.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

About two thirds of the way up we hit a path which led up to the ridge rather more gradually, and a short stroll took us on to the summit, along with the usual debate about which rock was th highest. I found Creag Ruadh to be much more interesting than Meal Chuaich, enjoying a good view over Allt Cuaich, which interestingly does not have an h after the c!!!!(Or at least not in Butterfield).<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

Ian and I pushed up the landrover track besides Conachraig, and followed the subsequent track up to below Meikle Pap, which we did not ascend. Pausing briefly for a bite to eat, we had a view of the Great Cliffs as we topped the col, but then ascended immediately into the cloud on a steep boulder field leading up onto Lochnagar.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->When we hit this ridge, we knew that the climbing was pretty much done for the day, but finding the summit may be more problematic, as neither of us generally use a GPS for routefinding, and visibility was poor. As it turned out we needn&rsquo;t have worried, following the cliffs from above, the top of Cac Carn More was easily visible, and a bearing took us without difficulty to the summit of Cac Carn Beag. We were disappointed not to obtain a good view, however we were grateful to be in a cloud that was essentially dry. Ian had his eye on a few of the gullies, but it was obvious that they were pretty bare on the tops on t&rsquo;other side, and there were large unstable cornice' on our side.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Rather than return the same way, we opted to descend via Glas Allt, and past a rather nice waterfall.

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I dont think I need to say too much about this weekend (see also28th January 2006). As the pictures pretty much tell the story.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->On the Sunday we walked from Kington up over Hergest Ridge. The route is nice and gentle, so much so that Fred pushed young Katie up in her pushcair to the very summit. The group split here, with most of the party returning back along the ridge into Kington. Myself, Andy Brown, Mike, Guy, Sarah, Richard, and Lord John of Leintwardine proceeded in the general direction of Bradnor Hill.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Whilst the ascent up Bradnor Hill is forestry track for approximately 3/4 of the way, we came to a strecth of felled forest which we made our way through in some discomfort. This being with the exception of the rather weedy characters who skirted around the long way - and no the pink shirt wearing J20 drinker was not one of them!!!!!!<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The top of Bradnor Hill is a rather bizarre place, where one treks through a number of holes on the golf course to attain the highest point. The buggy tack affords a quick descent back into Kington.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

As the pictures pretty much tell the story.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->On the Saturday, after recovering oneself from bed, I promptly drove up with Mike and Sarah from Kington YHA and met up with the remainder of our group at New Radnor.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Taking to the hillside we rose gently alongside Harley Dingle to reach the plateau like top of Great Rhos. A trek through the heather soon revealed the location of the trigonometry point. We then proceeded into the forest for lunch, before following the ridge along to the mast on Black Mixen, and to Bache Hill, taking in Little Creigiau on the way. Apparently this is a top on one of John Hipwood&rsquo;s lists, although I am not familiar with it. We then procceded over Whimble, and descended along Harley Dingle into New Radnor. Here the non-drinking members of the party enjoyed a few pints in a rather nice pub entitled the Eagle.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->A pleasant stroll with Andy, Jan and Sarah. Walking from Llanberis, we headed up Maesgwm to the Bwlch between Moel Cynghorion and Foel Goch. We headed up over Foel Goch, Foel Gron, and Moel Eilio, before heading down the directmost of the two ridges leading down into Llanberis.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I chose this route as I had been intending for some time to &lsquo;do&rsquo; Eilio, and with the forecast abysmal, it seemed a good option. The weather was never really as bad as the forecasts suggested, though I&rsquo;d imagine it was pretty arctic on top of Snowdon. The rain became heavier during the afternoon, and we were to get wet returning from Pete&rsquo;s Eats to the coach!<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->And as I am not bagging I did not know that this was Marilyn number 64!!!!!!!!<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->This meet was the clubs new year trip, which is essentially a very social meet. A large led walk of about 40 people were led by John Eadon and myself from Llanvihangel-Crucorney across the fields to join the Beacons Wat. Skirting around the West flank of the hill we rejoined the Beacons Way South of Ysgyryd Fawr, and ascended the hill from the South. We enjoyed a rather nice stroll along the ridge which had received a peppering of snow. Summiting the hill we turned back south for about 200m to join the track heading East off the hill, and returned to the Skirrid Inn by the rout we had come in upon, with one notable short cut.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Won&rsquo;t say too much about certain mutineering led walkers except the following. If you play the game as well as you talk it why are you on a led walk? Furthermore, why don&rsquo;t you lead one? I think that states my position in no uncertain terms.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I had decided not to go up Bidean nam Bian on the Thursday, as I had already ascended it, was not too fussed about Sgreamach, and was feeling pretty rough after the previous day. The weather was awful on the Friday, and it had been decided in adavance that it would be our rest (shopping) day in Fort William. And it was here that we kitted Mr. Eadon out with new gloves and rucksack, in an attempt to prevent him from killing himself from hypothermia on a hill one day.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->On the Saturday we set out for Beinn a' Bheithir on what would turn out to be a fateful day. Yes there was a death, but regrettably it came not in the form of a human, but in fact was John&rsquo;s alternator, or generator upon which he is so insistent on referring to it. Arriving at the Car Park at Gleann a' Chaolais, we immediately turned round, and the car died altogether as John reversed it into a parking slot at the accomodation. The yellow pimp mobile in the last photograph is the car procured by John to replace it.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->A rather light Hogmanay was conducted to facilitate a climb on Beinn a' Bheithir on the Sunday, New Years Day. We worked our way up the forest track from the car park, a newly constructed path lifting us high onto the hillside above Gleann a Chaolais. We fought our way across an ice ridden track to the climb up to the foot of climb up to the bealach.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Whereas ice had been the main contention on the Aonachs, on Beinn a' Bheithir it was slush. Particularly on the ascent of Sgorr Dhonuill it was very slippery, and with my slip on Aonach Beag in mind, I was not very happy, and moved very slowly. Summiting Sgorr Dhonuill we turned immediately back for the bealach, having been the first to summit the hill in 2006. It was very slippery on the way down from here, and I certainly took my time. We ascended up Sgorr Dhearg where we met several groups who had ascended directly from Ballachulish, and on the summit Chris produced a bottle of Champagne.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->On descent we took the Ballachulish ridge, as that heading straight for the church appeared prohibitively steep from the summit. We reached a point on the Ballachulish Ridge where it too appeard very steep and slushy, with crampons not being an effective option on this terrain, we descended via Beinn Bhan over a gentle tussocky slope. As the path disappeared we descended directly over the fields, and into Ballachulish from where we walked back up the road to the car park at the foot of Gleann a' Chaolais.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->We had a good week all told, I probably lost a little confidence if the truth be told, but hopefully I will recover that by the time I arrive at Newtonmore in February.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
